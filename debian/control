Description: the MSX emulator that aims for perfection
 openMSX is an open source MSX emulator that uses a unique emulation model,
 which tries to achieve the highest level of accuracy possible. It allows
 emulating a large number of different MSX machines. Combined with the
 C-BIOS ROM-files that are available in a separate package, you can run game
 ROM-files without the need for non-free BIOS ROM files.
