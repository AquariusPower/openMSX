# add things todo to this file, to avoid them being forgotten

* backend issues: [MSXDevice <-> OS/SDL]
 - trackball support
 - LED status visualization

* devices: [MSXDevice]
 - Music Module Devices
 - RS232 (Modem) [Wouter: hardware is 8254 connected to 8251
                          8254 is emulated (untested)]
 - Moonsound Devices
 - V9958

* config:
 - xmlconfig save support
 - support for saving states of devices
 - http support
 - settings.xml with own DTD?
 - dynamic options with XML files
 - do key bindings in a seperate file, not with autocommands
 - The following settings should be added to settings.xml:
   + blur
   + scanline
   + frameskip
   + mute status
   + deinterlace
 - The following things should be made settings (adjustable in Console):
   + Mixer settings
 - The following Console commands need to be converted to a settings command:
   + renderer
   + throttle (should also be a 'toggle' command)
   - toggle should be documented in commands.txt. Also other new settings
     should be documented there, some still aren't.
   
* build
 - auto* improvement
 - C++ standard compliancy (gcc-3.0 e.g.)

* general
 - switch the threads
 - I/O port configuration
 - session management? (save state of frontswitches and inserted disk or
   cassette images at exit for a specific machine; also speed setting and
   things plugged into connector)
