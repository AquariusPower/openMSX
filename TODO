# add things todo to this file, to avoid them being forgotten

* backend issues: [MSXDevice <-> OS/SDL]
 - trackball support
 - LED status visualization

* devices: [MSXDevice]
 - Music Module Devices
 - RS232 (Modem) [Wouter: hardware is 8254 connected to 8251
                          8254 is emulated (untested)]
 - Moonsound Devices
 - V9958

* config:
 - xmlconfig save support
 - support for saving states of devices
 - http support
 - settings.xml should get its own doctype and DTD:
   it is essentially different from hardware descriptions.
 - Key bindings are currently stored in settings.xml, which is the right place.
   However, they are still stored as autocommands, which is not good.
 - The following settings should be added to settings.xml:
   (Note that you can use AutoCommands in settings.xml to do this also,
   so this may be obsolete!)
   + blur
   + scanline
   + frameskip
   + mute status
   + deinterlace
   + speed
   + limitsprites
 - The following things should be made settings (adjustable in Console):
   + Mixer settings
 - Currently a ROM file name passed on the command line is used to generate
   XML in memory which is later used to create a Rom object. However, this
   complicates the process of gathering the ROM meta info in RomInfo, because
   different action has to be taken on ROMs from the command line and ROMs
   from the machine description.
   It would be better to skip the XML creation and just pass the ROM file name
   to the Rom constructor.
   When parsing the machine decription XML, incomplete ROM info should not
   be tolerated. So essential info like id (name) and mapper type should be
   mandatory. Other info such as manufacturer and year is desirable, but not
   essential.

* build
 - auto* improvement
 - C++ standard compliancy (gcc-3.0 e.g.)

* general
 - switch the threads
 - I/O port configuration
 - session management? (save state of frontswitches and inserted disk or
   cassette images at exit for a specific machine; also speed setting and
   things plugged into connector)
