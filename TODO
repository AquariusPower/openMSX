# add things todo to this file, to avoid them being forgotten

In short: better check our RFE and Bug trackers, since this file is hardly ever
updated.

* backend issues: [MSXDevice <-> OS/SDL]
 - trackball support

* devices: [MSXDevice]
 - V9958 (scrolling in character modes)
 - V9948 (if necessary, on our Daewoo CPC-400S model, at least screen 9 seems
   to work with V9938 already; however, we don't have a real Korean machine to
   really check this)

* config:
 - support for saving states of devices
 - http support
 - settings.xml should get its own doctype and DTD:
   it is essentially different from hardware descriptions.
 - Currently a ROM file name passed on the command line is used to generate
   XML in memory which is later used to create a Rom object. However, this
   complicates the process of gathering the ROM meta info in RomInfo, because
   different action has to be taken on ROMs from the command line and ROMs
   from the machine description.
   It would be better to skip the XML creation and just pass the ROM file name
   to the Rom constructor.
   When parsing the machine decription XML, incomplete ROM info should not
   be tolerated. So essential info like id (name) and mapper type should be
   mandatory. Other info such as manufacturer and year is desirable, but not
   essential.

* general
 - session management? (save state of firmwareswitches and inserted disk or
   cassette images at exit for a specific machine; also speed setting and
   things plugged into connector)
