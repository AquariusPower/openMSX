	   - except for sending and receiving data it works, thus
	     timers and interrupt generation work

2003-07-06 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* added a debug device. 
	* Details for control are in docs/debugdevice.txt

2003-06-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented automatic .cas to .wav conversion in CassettePlayer:
	  - not all .cas files seems to work though
	  - there can be a delay of a few seconds while converting the file,
	    need to do the conversion in a helper thread
	* added peekMem() method, will be used by debugger to savly read mem

2003-06-28 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Cleaned up the machines and extensions dir:
	  - added a subdir 'roms' when needed
	  - added the Id tags when missing
	  - filename cleanups
	  - fixed some typos
	  - added SHA1SUMS files in each roms dir, when available
	* Added a few extensions

2003-06-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented Listener interface for Setting class

2003-06-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>

	* Implemented 'fallback' mechanism for files in settings.xml

2003-06-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented undocumented flag bits for "BIT n,(HL)" instructions,
	  ZEXALL test still passes

2003-06-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Improved performance for tab-completion:
	    without this patch "diska <tab>" could take several seconds

2003-06-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented HBI-55 data cartridge:
	    according to some BASIC test progs it seems to work, but not yet
	    tested with Sony_HB_75P internal software

2003-06-09 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Released openmsx-0.3.2.

2003-06-09 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Updated HOWTO (please check)
	* Updated/cleaned up machine configs:
	  - MSX2+ machines have a memory mapper of 64kB (tested on real
	    Panasonic FS-A1WX)
	  - Changed ROM names in 8250 config to match the ones used in the
	    other configs, using a 32kB combined ROM for basic/bios
	  - Added missing CVS Id tags
	  - Removed unnecessary DiskRomPatches from machines with TC8566AF FDC's
	  - Changed FDC type names to new conventions (see 2003-03-29), note
	    that the old ones won't work anymore. The names of the FDC classes
	    should be revised though.

2003-06-09 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Implemented user-specified gamma correction for SDLLo/SDLHi/SDLGL.
	  Find out your PC monitor's gamma using the measurement image on the
	  following page: http://www.bberger.net/gamma.html
	  TVs use a standardised gamma of 2.5. So for a realistic picture, set
	  openMSX gamma correction to: PC_gamma / 2.5.
	  Or you can just try a few values and see what you like ;)

2003-06-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Don't abort on "cassetteplayer <file>" cmd with invalid filename
	* Print warning when initial font or background images can't be read

2003-06-08 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* In the command engine, only act on display mode switches if a
	  different command engine mode is entered.
	* Fixed various GCC 2.95 compile problems.

2003-06-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Print error msg when user gives wrong diskimage on the cmd line
	*  same for cas and wav images
	* Fix core dump while writing to read-only disk images
	* Don't put empty lines in console history

2003-06-06 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Added FloatSetting class.
	* Introduced new setting "gamma" for gamma correction.
	  Not yet implemented in Renderers.
	* Refactored EnumSetting:
	  - Split into type-safe inline wrapper class "EnumSetting" and
	    type-indedendent implementation class "IntStringMap".
	    Forced template instantiations are no longer necessary.
	  - Made strings in string-enum map constant.

2003-06-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Refactored consolecolumns and consolerows settings

2003-06-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Merged Arjan's YMF278 fixes/improvements, plus did some optimizations
	* Take default MapperIO type in case the machine configuration doesn't
	  specify one (all MSX1 machines)

2003-06-04 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* New console font: ConsoleFontRaveL.png, this is a larger version of
	  ConsoleFontRave.png (easier to read on hi-res screens).
	* New extensions: 512K/1MB/2MB/4MB external mapper.

2003-06-04 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Background and Fonts are not reset anymore when changing renderers.
	* Added 10 machine configurations, made by BifiMsx

2003-06-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* support 8kb roms
	* fixed SDLFont, sometimes the font was completely transparent
	* fixed UMR in Timer class (caused Toshiba rom to hang openMSX)
	* Implemented fake "per pixel alpha blending" for SDLFont

2003-06-03 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed SDLGL tile cache when character and pattern table use mirroring.
	  Solves glitches in Dr Archie, Relax and probably others.

2003-06-02 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* New console font: ConsoleFontRave.png, based on Bitstream Vera, but
	  renamed due to license requirements (see http://www.gnome.org/fonts/).
	* Re-encoded existing console fonts to make their files smaller.

2003-06-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented MegaRam
	* Implemented PAC  (like FM-PAC, but without FM and without ROM)

2003-06-01 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Added a setting for grabbing mouse and keyboard input. When input
	  is grabbed, the windowsmanager won't be able to mask keys from
	  openmsx and the mousecursor won't be able to leave the openmsx
	  window.

2003-06-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed mouse (hopefully)
	* Removed "loadsram" and "savesram" settings

2003-05-31 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* When pausing, store last frame and keep plotting it during pause.
	  Also keep redrawing the console, so it is usable during pause.
	  Current implementation is a bit of a hack, but it works.
	* Implemented afterglow effect, try "set glow N" in SDLGL.

2003-05-31 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* VDPCmdEngine cleanups

2003-05-31 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Changed console save file into ascii. When loading the history,
	  empty lines are ignored.
	* Removed error when unable to load consolehistory
	* Only two identical commando's directly after eachothers are now
	  removed if removedoubles is active to improve performance.
	* Remove settings for consolehistory load & save. Default are now:
	  - Always load and save.
	  - Filename is now fixed as 'history.txt'

2003-05-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Refactored VDPCmdEngine, use VDPCmd subclasses for each command
	  instead of function pointers

2003-05-30 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Implemented save/load consolehistory

2003-05-30 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Implemented Text2 and MultiColour modes in SDLGL using one texture
	  per character approach (the approach Graphic2/3 already used).
	* Implemented screen accuracy.
	* Do not sync during a skipped frame.

2003-05-27 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	Dirty checking improvements:
	* Removed all old character dirty checking code from SDLRenderer and
	  SDLGLRenderer.
	* Added DirtyChecker class, a generic VRAM cache administration.
	* Use new DirtyChecker in SDLGLRenderer for pattern and colour table.
	  Caching the name table is useless in SDLGLRenderer.
	This is a work in progress, but the current state seems to be stable.

2003-05-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* More RealTimeRTC improvements
	* Some frameskip tuning
	* Keep frameskip setting between renderer switch

2003-05-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Use RTC Timer for RealTime syncing when available

2003-05-25 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed a problem with the consolesize when switching from SDLLo
	  to SDLHi or SDLGL.
	* When the console is resized, the text in it will be rebuild.
	* Fixed a bug in the cursormovement (broke with the text rebuild).

2003-05-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Split RealTime in generic part and implementation specific part.
	  This decouples time synchronization from SDL and paves the way
	  for more accurate implementation (like RTC)

2003-05-24 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* I/O to extended VRAM now goes to limbo, instead of main VRAM.
	* Changed VDPVRAM::Window to VRAMWindow.
	  There is not much added value to a public inner class in C++...
	* Changed VDPVRAM::VRAMObserver to VRAMObserver, in its own file.
	  Own file reduces the risk of cyclic header dependencies.
	* Renderer gets VRAM updates through VRAMObserver.
	  This is a preparation for later optimisations.
	* Make sure no sprite checking is done in spriteless display modes.
	* In a spriteless mode, or when sprites are disabled, the entire sprite
	  plane is skipped. This is more efficient than the previous checks for
	  a "no sprites" situation, because it occurs earlier in the rendering
	  process.

2003-05-24 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* commands can now be on multiple lines in the console.

2003-05-23 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed an error when processing the commandline and one
	  device exists twice in the configurationfile(s).

2003-05-21 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Double commands in the console commandhistory can no
	  longer occur.
	* Made 'remove doubles' and history size configurable

2003-05-20 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented run-time tuneable volume for sound devices

2003-05-19 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Implemented search history in the console
	* added Ctrl-C to clear the current command.

2003-05-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added MoonSound:
	  - code was largly taken from mame
	  - fm part is quite good already
	  - wave part still needs some improvements:
	     - some waves sound weird at certain frequencies??
	     - missing features like: pseudo-reverb, LFO, vibrato, ...

2003-05-18 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Released openmsx-0.3.1.

2003-05-18 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Converted a lot of spaces into tabs.
	* Changed int into bool for zoomSurface().
	* Fixed indentation in zoomSurface().

2003-05-18 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Removed "ConsoleSource" directory and moved its code elsewhere:
	  - actual console code moved to new directory "console"
	  - command code moved to existing directory "events"
	  - circular buffer code moved to directory "src"
	* Moved input devices code to new directory "input".
	  Maybe more can be moved there in the future.
	* Changed "cpudebug" command into "cputrace" setting.
	  Also fixed the duplicate "cpudebug" command on a turbo R (dual CPU).
	  Note: this setting exists only if "cpu" dir is built in debug mode.

2003-05-17 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Removed EmuTime parameter from Command::execute.
	  Since most commands do not interact with the emulated machine,
	  they do not need EmuTime.
	* Removed EmuTime parameter from EventListener.
	  The only reason this was needed before, was to execute commands.
	* Removed code that is no longer needed in the single thread model.
	* Fixed event handling during pause.

2003-05-17 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Implemented configurable file-extentions.
	* Lined the help-text up, properly.
	* Renamed lines/rows/columns/width/height -> rows/columns
	* Fixed a uncaught exception when the SDLConsole is resized
	  and the backgroundfile can't be loaded.
	* Fixed -h when the specified machine can't be loaded.
	* Console now resets the scrollback when any key other than 
	  page up/down is used.
	* Fixed the blinking cursor in the SDLConsole.
	* Fixed Ctrl-A/E when numlock is active
	* Fixed a few small bugs in the CommandLineParser.

2003-05-17 Reikan <openMSX4Win32@ranpub.com>
	* Changed to single thread model.
	  Now fixed SDLGL renderer fault on XFree86-4.3.0.

2003-05-11 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed colour of font on GLConsole overlayed on Text1 mode.

2003-05-11 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed segfault in the SDL background scaling when using 8bpp.
	  tested and working in 15,16 and 24 bpp. in 8 bpp it doesn't
	  give a segfault, but since the whole display isn't working, I
	  can't see if the scaling really works.
	* SDL backgroundimage can now have any pixelformat.
	* SDL Console characters are no longer blended.

2003-05-10 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Fixed wrong initial default size of the console.
	* Fixed range of the consolecolumns-setting

2003-05-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Replaced old YM2413 code by new one. Volume still needs some tuning:
	   - relative volume between music and drum channels
	   - relative volume between YM2413 and other sound chips

2003-05-09 Herman Oudejans <hn.oudejans@quicknet.nl>
	* Added resizing and moving to the console.
	* Extended the console editing keys.
	* Added keyrepeat to the console.
	* Added setValueInt() and setRange() to Integersetting.
	* Added SDL background scaling.

2003-05-08 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Another GCC 3.3-pre fix: passing signed byte references as unsigned
	  byte references. Typecasting to "(byte &)" instead of "(byte)" works
	  on both GCC 3.2 and GCC 3.3-pre.

2003-05-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* a few fixes in new YM2413 code. Still not made default because
	  drums in illusion city are screwed

2003-05-06 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Compiled with GCC 3.3-pre:
	  - Fixed missing "#include <cassert>" directives.
	  - Fixed some warnings, suppressed others.

2003-05-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* release openmsx-0.3.0
	* added "mbstereo" extension

2003-05-04 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Swapped the threads: event handling now occurs in the main thread,
	  emulation occurs in a worker thread. Inspired by Reikan's UOW32 patch.
	  This removes a lot of differences between the Linux and Win32 ports.
	  Also, renderer switching and runtime full screen toggle should work
	  on Win32 now.
	* Bug fixes on thread swap:
	  - Fixed compile error on GCC 2.95.
	  - Workaround for incompatibility of SDL_PushEvent.
	  - Print exceptions thrown in emulation thread.
	* Minor bug fix on video init attempts in RendererFactories.
	* Merged Reikan's configure.ac improvements.
	* Fixed magnified sprites in sprite mode 2.
	  Glitches in Eindeloos are gone.
	* Fixed bug: display was disabled after switching renderers during
	  overscan (for example Unknown Reality title screen).
	* Fixed bug: possible writes outside screen buffer on overscan.
	  Crashed Ark-a-Noah on SDLHi.

2003-05-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Trojka starts playing ADPCM samples without initializing the
	  sample volume. The sample volume after a reset was set to
	  minimum, changed it to maximum.

2003-05-03 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Removed EmuTime parameters from Settings methods.
	* Centralized GL header check in new GLUtil.hh file.
	  In the future, GLUtil.hh will contain GL utility classes/functions.
	* Replaced "renderer" command by a "renderer" setting.
	  This also makes sure the user cannot switch to a non-existant renderer.
	* Moved "Rom.(hh|cc)" and "SRAM.(hh|cc)" from "src" to "src/memory".
	* Removed obsolete "cfg" directory; configurations are in "share" now.

2003-05-02 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added the Contrib/cbios directory to 'make install'
	* Have make install create some nice softlinks
	* Added md5sum files

2003-04-30 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Introduced Blender class and use it from Character/BitmapConverter.
	* Implemented narrow SCREEN6 sprite pixels in SDLGL.
	* Implemented blended SCREEN6 sprite pixels in SDLLo.
	* Refactored ROM related classes to get device ID from hardwareconfig.xml
	  into RomInfo.
	  In the process all mapper type code has been centralized in RomInfo.
	  All of this just to get "slot 3.3: Firmware" in the slotmap ;)

2003-04-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fix tabcompletion for absolute paths

2003-04-28 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Fixed make install to /opt/openMSX and create extra link for
	  binary in /usr/local/bin
	* added (no)debug to main makefile

2003-04-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented more complete filename completion as described in
	  feature request 713442

2003-04-27 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Added a console background to SDLGL when no image is used.
	* Minor cleanups to console classes.
	* Take horizontal adjust into account for calculating HR and horizontal
	  retrace interrupt timing.
	  Fixes some of the glitches in No Waste, but not all.
	* Fixed text colour in Text1 mode in SDLGL: reverted a misguided
	  optimisation. (in GL, full intensity of int is 0x7FFFFFFF, not 0xFF)
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.16.

2003-04-25 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Allowed JoyNet to accept a new connection if
	  previous connection is closed.

2003-04-25 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed sprite colours in Graphic5 (SCREEN6).
	  The turbo R boot logo looks OK now.
	  However, narrow sprite pixels do not yet work in SDLGL.
	* Implemented horizontal scroll high and multi page in SDLGL.
	  This implementation is based on Wouter's horizontal scroll patch.
	* Implemented horizontal scroll high and multi page in SDLHi/Lo.
	Note that some horizontal scroll features are still missing:
	* Multi page scrolling in combination with deinterlace.
	* Scrolling in character modes.
	However, the current state should be enough to run most games and demos.

2003-04-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* if an extension exists both in user as in system directory, prefer
	  the one in user directory

2003-04-23 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Added update calls for horizontal scroll settings.

2003-04-22 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Partial horizontal scroll implementation: scroll low and border mask.
	  Scroll high and multi page to be done.
	  Space Manbow works fine in MSX2+ mode now.

2003-04-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Improved DACSound quality:
	   - improved quality at the expense of an (extra) delay
	   - samples in Swiss Demo sound acceptable now
	   - modplayer sounds better but still not very good
	* Updated FMPAC:
	   - ROM is not visible while SRAM is active

2003-04-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added alternative YM2413 core (implemented by Jarek Burczynski):
	   - still needs some work before it can replace old core
	      - volume needs some tuning
	      - performance optimizations (silent channels)
	      - bug fixes(?)
	   - if you want to try it copy YM2413.cc.new and YM2413.hh.new over
	     YM2413.cc and YM2413.hh and recompile

2003-04-18 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Fixed a bug in JoyNet, but need a program with a good asyncron
	  protocol to test it

2003-04-17 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Separated drawSprites from drawDisplay in subclasses of PixelRenderer.

2003-04-16 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Moved display coordinate calculation from subclasses to PixelRenderer.

2003-04-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reworked SCC
	   - Manuel Pazos's SCC detection routine works correctly now
	   - Optimized for common case. You mostly write to SCC and hardly
	     ever read from it

2003-04-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reworked consoles:
	   - splitted console in "core console" and "console renderer",
	     the main advantage is that command history is preserved
	     while switching renderers

2003-04-12 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Created util.hh: currently only contains fillBool, which used to be
	  duplicated in SDLRenderer and SDLGLRenderer.
	* Removed system.h: this file has probably been obsolete for some time,
	  but managed to escape everyone's attention.
	* Changed SDLGLRenderer to use SpriteConverter.

2003-04-10 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Moved the VDP and rendering code into new "video" directory.
	  Thanks to Manuel for suggesting how to solve symbol dependencies.
	  But I still don't like recursive Make...

2003-04-09 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Merged SDLLoRenderer and SDLHiRenderer into SDLRenderer.
	  Template expansion replaces duplicated code.
	  From a user perspective, "SDLLo" and "SDLHi" still exist.

2003-04-06 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Clean up in RomInfo stuff for empty ROMs. Note that I'm now assuming
	  that an empty ROM is always an empty SCC. Is this a valid
	  assumption? The problem is that `forced' ROM types (as with an empty
	  SCC) are not put in the ROMInfo. So I can't check if it is really
	  an SCC...

2003-04-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added Korean80-in-1 mapper type
	* Added Korean90-in-1 mapper type
	* Added Korean126-in-1 mapper type
	* Implemented "keyjoystick", joystick emulation via keyboard:
	   - use like this "plug joyporta keyjoystick"
	   - joystick direction is mapped on cursors
	              button-A               space
	              button-B               left alt
	   - TODO mapping should become configurable
	   - TODO you should be able to configure more than one keyjoystick
	* Implemented V9958 CMD bit:
	   I don't know any program that actually uses this, so it is 
	   not yet tested

2003-04-04 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Getting everything in /opt/openmsx installed, no links yet

2003-04-04 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Introduced SpriteConverter, a utility class for the Renderers to use,
	  similar to BitmapConverter and CharacterConverter.
	* Changed SDLHiRenderer to use SpriteConverter.
	* Removed PixelRenderer's protected fields from SDLGL and SDLHi.

2003-04-03 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed remaining reads of uninitialised VDP fields.

2003-04-02 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* First cleanups to prepare for a 'make install'

2003-04-02 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Minor cleanups in SpriteChecker.

2003-03-31 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Turned DisplayMode into a class (makes code easier to read).
	* SpriteChecker no longer checks sprites in text mode.
	* Various minor cleanups along the way.

2003-03-31 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Don't abort (only warn) when there occurs an error during processing
	  of autocommands
	* Converted "frontswitch" command into a setting

2003-03-30 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Removed fullScreen parameter from Renderer constructors.
	* Made Renderer constructors private, only available to their
	  respective factories.
	* VDP subsystem reset methods are no longer called by their constructor,
	  instead they are called explicitly by the VDP.
	* Removed EmuTime parameter from VDP subsystem constructors.
	* Rearranged VDP constructor to remove overlap with reset method.
	* Fixed uses of display mode which could not yet handle the YJK bits.
	* Fixed a tricky bug that could occur if rendering was performed in the
	  middle of a series of updates that all occur at the same EmuTime.

2003-03-29 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Moved other configs from src/cfg to share/machines
	* Added some more extensions
	* Changed settings.xml to use cbios-msx2 and added skins/ prefix to
	  ConsoleFont.png
	* Updated the HOWTO. I wish the make install was finished, so that I
	  can cut 10% of the HOWTO... (it's getting complicated to explain...)

2003-03-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed crashes on missing arguments (e.g. "openmsx -ext")
	* Added extra FDC names:
	     National  --> MB8877A
	     Panasonic --> TC8566AF
	     Philips   --> WD2793
	  The old names are deprecated, as soon as the machine configuartions
	  are changed to use the new names, the old names will be removed.
	* Fixed crash on missing console font

2003-03-28 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* More refactoring of Rom objects to add RomInfo:
	  - all Rom objects now have a RomInfo object
	  - get information that was in the romdb from that object
	  - slotmap uses this and prints real Rom info, when available; later,
	    the GUI should be able to use this too, in some way
	  - note that all MSXRom constructors changed :-)
	  - note that it's my first big change, please fix things that 
	    could be a lot better and tell me about it :-)
	    Maarten, Wouter and Joost: thanks for your help!
	* Added loads of machine configs (thanks Atarulum):
	  - when we decide what to do with the patches for the FDC, I'll
	    add the others

2003-03-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed RomPanasonic SRAM
	* Optimized VDPCmdEngine for common case: no command in progress

2003-03-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed VDP Command Engine bug:
	   - on every sync() the engine processed at least one 'pixel',
	     when you poll the VDP very fast (R800) the time between
	     two syncs is less than one pixel. This screws up the
	     bookkeeping.
	   - Fixes MSXView startup problem, Relax demo, ...

2003-03-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Another directory structure change:
	   moved machines/     -> share/machines/
	         extensions/   -> share/extensions/
	         etc/romdb.xml -> share/romdb.xml
	         settings.xml  -> share/settings.xml
	* Create share directory, moved a lot of files around

2003-03-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reimplemented Panasonic memory system:
	   - in TurboR rom/ram are tightly connected (dram mode, ...)
	     Memorymapper, RomMapper, BiosRom are now implemented as special
	     as special devices
	   - TurboR hardwareconfig.xml updated
	   - MSXView almost works now, without "set cmdtiming broken" openmsx
	     wait for a never ending VDP command. Still investigating...

2003-03-22 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* Refactored ROM mappertype retrieval/ROM Info (WIP, to enable readout
	  of ROM info in the console.)

2003-03-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented timeout for reading mouse:
	   - this fixes the '"plug joyporta mouse" in settings.xml' bug
	   - current timeout is 1/100s, I've no idea of the timeout
	     value of a real MSX mouse

2003-03-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Various minor optimizations / cleanups, mostly better cache for
          unmapped memory regions

2003-03-16 Manuel Bilderbeek <manuel@msxnet.org>
	* When a ROM is found in the romdb, the info about the ROM is now
	  printed. Later, this info could be stored somewhere, so that the GUI
	  can use it to show a ROM title, e.g.

2003-03-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added HALNOTE mapper type:
	   - Doesn't work yet! Only 'normal' rom switching is emulated.
	     The program also writes to pages 0 en 3 and it selects rom
	     pages > 0x80, I've no idea what this should do.
	* Fixed format command, apparently I broke it several months ago.

2003-03-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "vramdump" console command, only available when
	  compiled with DEBUG

2003-03-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reworked MSXRom:
	   - made a (small) subclass for every mapper type:
	* Moved MSXRom MSXRam related files to a new directory "memory"
	* Fixed rom-cartridge SRAM saving, path was wrong:
	   - it is now ~/.openMSX/persistent/roms/<romname>/<sramname>

2003-03-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "Harry Fox" mapper type
	* Fixed ASCII8 mapper type:
	   Annimal Land works now

2003-03-03 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed bug in PixelRenderer: finishFrame was called every frame,
	  even with frame skip active.
	  This also fixes the special effects in GL with frame skip active.

2003-03-02 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Introduced RendererFactory.
	  This should help in making the renderer selection a setting.
	  It will also make it possible to query which renderers are available.

2003-03-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Converted "frameskip" console command into a setting
	* Implemented BooleanSetting as a specialization of EnumSetting<bool>
	* Fixed path resolution bug:
	   all files were also searched for relative to the current directory

2003-03-01 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.15.

2003-03-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Converted "throttle" console command into a setting
	* Converted "pause" console command into a setting
	* Converted "mute" console command into a setting
	* Converted "console" console command into a setting

2003-02-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Converted "speed" console command into a setting

2003-02-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented free slot selection:
	   - this is only a temporary solution, it will very likely change
	     in the next release
	   - when you specify -1 for the primary slot, the cartridge will
	     be inserted in a free external slot. Very usefull to write
	     generic extensions.
	* romdb.xml is now searched in /opt/openMSX/etc/romdb.xml
	                         or in ~/.openMSX/etc/romdb.xml
	* removed -fmpac and -musmod command line options, they are
	  replaced by extensions

2003-02-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* extension directory now has the same structure as the
	  machines directory:
	   - for example the scc extension lives in
	       ~/.openMSX/extensions/scc/hardwareconfig.xml
	* Implemented Jon's SCC amplitude measurements

2003-02-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented command line extensions:
	   - you can load configuration files located in
	      ~/.openMSX/extensions/
	      /opt/openMSX/extensions/
	     with the "-ext" command line option
	   - example:
	      ./openmsx SDNATCH1.DSK -ext scc+
	* Removed -msx1 -msx2 -msx2+ -turbor command line options
	* SRAM of rom cartridges is saved in
	    ~/.openMSX/persistent/roms/<rom-name>/

2003-02-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "console_font" setting:
	   - change the console font at run-time
	* Fixed SCC+

2003-02-19 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Implemented "toggle" command, which toggles any BooleanSetting.
	* Replaced "fullscreen" command by "toggle fullscreen".
	* Support key binding of command including parameters.

2003-02-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reworked File / FileContext classes:
	   - separated "searchpath-resolution" from file opening
	* Implemented "console_background" setting:
	   - change the console background at run-time

2003-02-16 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed a bug in the VDP, where display-on was reported before the sync
	  with VDP subsystems was completed. Can cause the command engine to
	  run too slow, among other things.

2003-02-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* First step to persistent state directories:
	   - persistent state files are saved in
	      ~/.openMSX/persistent/<machine>/<username>/
	   - <machine> is the name of the directory where we found the
	     hardware description. Maybe we should get this from inside the
	     config file?
	   - it's not yet possible to specify <username>, so for now it's
	     always "untitled<n>"
	* Default machine can be specified in settings.xml:
	   - see example settings.xml, this will load
	      ~/.openMSX/machine/nms8250/hardwareconfig.xml
	* Added "-machine" command line option

2003-02-13 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Made "full screen" into a setting.
	  The "fullscreen" command still works, but will disappear in the future.

2003-02-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Uninline cpu rdmem and wrmem slowpaths:
	   this actually increased performance a little
	* RTC uses generic SRAM class for persistent data:
	   - SRAM is now the _only_ class in the whole tree that writes files
	   - parameters "filename, load, save" changed to "sramname, loadsram,
	     savesram". This means all configuartion files must be updated.
	* Implemented SCC+ subtypes:
	   "Snatcher" "SD-Snatcher" "mirrored" "expanded"

2003-02-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed MSX-AUDIO mapper:
	   - it has 4 pages of 32kB instead of only 2
	   - it has 4kB RAM
	   - is mirrored at 0x8000-0xffff
	* Fixed Y8950 interrupt masks

2003-02-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented Panasonic MSX-Audio mapper type (untested)

2003-02-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Compiled with some extra warnings enabled and fixed the
	  resulting warnings
	* Renamed MSXRomDevice to Rom (it isn't a device anymore)
	* Default values for settings.xml:
	   - all sections in settings.xml now have default values if they
	     are left out the config file
	   - don't abort when settings.xml is not found
	   - but I really advise _against_ using these features

2003-01-31 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "user directories" (see settings.xml)
	* Fixed "specify other config file" bug
	* Relative-from-config was broken, fixed it

2003-01-30 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* altered a code comment and added some extra config examples

2003-01-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented home-directory-substitution for local files:
	   When a filename starts with "~", this character is replaced by
	   the content of the environment variable HOME. I'm not sure
	   this will work for non-UNIX OS'es.
	* Implemented system-directories:
	   - The files romdb.xml, msxconfig.xml and settings.xml are searched
	     in the "system directories". For the moment these are (in this
	     order)
	        ~/.openMSX/
	        ~/openMSX/
	        /usr/local/etc/openMSX/
	        /etc/openMSX/
	     But we need to discuss about this list. Note that "." is not in
	     the list.

2003-01-27 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Increased usefulness of error message in DeviceFactory

2003-01-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Automatically load "settings.xml" on startup:
	   - you can specify an alternative file with the "-setting" command
	     line option
	   - For the moment "settings.xml" must be in the current directory
	* Moved hard-coded HotKey bindings to settings.xml

2003-01-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed Z80/R800 switching again
	* Removed "sync_interval" parameter from RealTime

2003-01-26 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Relaxed over-zealous assert in PixelRenderer by one tick.

2003-01-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed TurboR assertion:
	   targetTime wasn't set properly when switching CPU (Z80 <-> R800)
	* Added dummy MSX-Midi:
	   Illusion city works now!

2003-01-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reworked MSX-MUSIC / FM-PAC:
	   removed enable/disable logic from MSX-MUSIC

2003-01-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Renamed "TurboR" FDC type to "Panasonic"
	* Fixed "cpudebug" command (I broke it yesterday)
	* Fixed MSXMatsushita:
	   this caused FS-4700 build-in word processor hang
	* Removed ROM files from CVS

2003-01-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Allow muliple commands with the same name:
	   - for example both Z80 and R800 could have a "cpudebug" command
	     at the same time (not implemeted yet)

2003-01-20 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Removed SearchPath stuff
	* Relative paths in config files are now relative to the location
	  of the config file:
	   - this together with the change above probably means you have
	     to rewrite some/all of your config files
	* Moved some #include's from .hh to .cc

2003-01-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented 8-bit unsigned 16-bit signed DAC
	* Implemented MSX-AUDIO 13-bit DAC:
	   untested because TurboR (needed for modplayer) is broken
	   for the moment

2003-01-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed MSXF4Device:
	   FS-A1FX (re)boots correctly now

2003-01-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Removed possibility to use other than XML config files

2003-01-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed Kanji12
	* Removed some unused classes from config directory

2003-01-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented Kanji 12x12:
	   - not tested, I don't have correct ROM
	* Implemented front switch:
	   - use console command "frontswitch [on/off]"
	   - not tested yet, will do it tomorrow

2003-01-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added powerOff() method to MSXDevice
	* Removed getCurrentTime() calls from destructors

2003-01-11 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* removed MSXCPU::getTargetTime() method
	* added EmuTime argument to the execute() method of a Command:
	   this removes some of the calls to MSXCPU::getCurrentTime()
	* An empty SCC cartridge no longer needs "/dev/zero" as filename,
	  just don't specify a filename:
	   this also works in OSes that don't support /dev/zero
	* Removed "readromfile" parameter from SCCPlusCart:
	   if you don't want to read a rom just don't specify one
	* Better(?) rom placement heuristics:
	   fixes zanac

2003-01-09 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed CPU on big endian machines
	* TurboR PCM update:
	   - It now works in Seed of Dragon, although the frequency seems
	     wrong. The game also hangs when you start to play.

2003-01-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed CPU HALT instruction
	* Semi-fixed CPU/Scheduler interaction:
	   - seems to work, but I still need to take a very close look at
	     the code

2003-01-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Large CPU rewrite:
	   - we never perform IO at a timestamp greater or equal than
	     the earliest sync point
	   - 1% - 2% slowdown compared to previous implementation
	   - ZEXALL tests still pass
	   - still need to verify if the timimng of the instructions is
	     still correct

2003-01-05 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed mode number for Text 2 in VDP::updateColourBase.
	* Recalculate pattern and colour base when switching modes.

2003-01-04 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Implemented colour and pattern index mask calculation.
	* Fixed remaining Doxygen warnings.

2003-01-03 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Fixed Doxygen warnings.
	* Fixed I/O port handling of Matsushita switched device, which I forgot
	  in yesterday's changes.

2003-01-02 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Moved I/O port registration out of VDP and into DeviceFactory.
	  Eventually, all I/O port registration should move to the machine
	  description file.
	* Moved I/O port registration of all other I/O devices out of the
	  device and into DeviceFactory (or FDCFactory in one case).

2003-01-01 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Workaround to prevent out-of-order I/O with the VDP.
	* Added asserts to VDP code to check timing constraints.
	* Fix for sprites in planar modes.
	* Fixed behaviour of port #99, #9A and #9B interference.
	* Colour and pattern base mask calculation are now done in a single
	  method each.

2002-12-30 Joost Yervante Damad <joost@lumatec.be>
	* updated AUTHORS

2002-12-30 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Let VDPVRAM::Window notify its observer of base/index changes and
	  windows that become disabled.

2002-12-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Autodetect BASIC ROM cartridges:
	   code mostly taken from windows port
	* Don't abort when "romdb.xml" is missing, just print a warning.
	* Added a lot of const qualifiers
	* Implemented TurboR PCM device:
	   - only playing (no recording)
	   - sound quality is really bad (like all our DACSound based devices)

2002-12-29 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* The VDPVRAM::VRAMObserver interface is put to use for the first time,
	  by SpriteChecker. Cleans up the VDP subsystem synchronisation code.

2002-12-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Released 0.2.1
	* Better rom placement heuristics:
	   should solve bug 658430 point 3 (rom files without "AB" header)
	* Allow filenames that contain a ',' on the commandline
	* Support roms that don't like to be mirrored:
	   - solves bug 658430 point 1 (BASIC prog at 0x8000)
	   - can't be autodetected (yet?), you must specify romtype as
	     "PAGE[...]" (examples "PAGE2", "PAGE01", "PAGE12", ...)
	   - romdb.xml should be updated for these 'problem' roms

2002-12-28 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Cleaned up sprite checker synchronisation.

2002-12-27 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Created VDPSettings class, moved cmdTiming there.
	* Moved limitSprites from config to VDPSettings.

2002-12-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Support for second MSX-AUDIO:
	   - add this to the AUDIO section in the config
	      <parameter name="number">2</parameter>
	   - alex' modplayer doesn't work yet :-(

2002-12-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Tabcompletion for setting values:
	   example:  set accuracy p<tab>
	* Implemented "cmdtiming" setting:
	   Switch between real or instantaneous VDP command timing.
	   Should only be used for debugging purposes.
	* Implemented YJK/YAE (screen11/12) rendering

2002-12-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Updated RealTime class:
	   - this should improve the cases where emulation is too slow,
	     but openMSX doesn't claim 100% CPU time
	* SDLLoRenderer inherits from PixelRenderer iso Renderer
	   - SDLLoRenderer now also has "accuracy" setting

2002-12-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Made some IDE stuff configurable:
	   - master/slave device
	   - HD image
	   - HD size is not yet configurable
	   - see someconfig.xml for format of new config

2002-12-17 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented MSX Bunsetsu Henkan / Jisyo:
	   - I don't have much info on this device, but at least BUNSDUMP.BAS
	     gives the correct result

2002-12-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed assertion in VDP when computer was reset while in PAL mode

2002-12-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented MSXDeviceSwitch:
	   - IO-ports 0x41-0x4F are (possibly) shared between several devices
	   - IO-port 0x40 selects the active device
	* Converted MSXS1985 to a MSXSwitchedDevice
	* Converted MSXFS4500SRAM to a MSXSwitchedDevice:
	   - renamed to MSXMatsushita
	   - implemented PUT KANJI function (IO-ports 0x43-0x44)

2002-12-09 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented correct mirroring for National based FDC's

2002-12-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented mmap() in File classes:
	   - map a file direclty into the process memory range, the OS can
	     perform some optimizations this way:
	      - only read data when actually used
	      - faster swapping
	      - ...
	   - I'm not sure non-UNIX OSes (windows) have a similar function,
	     if not there is a fallback implemented in FileBase (we also
	     need this fallback for FTP, HTTP, ... files)
	* Simplified/updated MSXRomDevice:
	   - simpler interface: you no longer need to inherit from MSXRomDevice
	   - use mmap() to read files
	* Implemented FS4500SRAM (suggestions for a better name are welcome):
	   put this in your config file:
	     <device id="FS4500 SRAM">
	       <type>FS4500SRAM</type>
	       <parameter name="loadsram">true</parameter>
	       <parameter name="savesram">true</parameter>
	       <parameter name="sramname">FS4500.SRAM</parameter>
	     </device>

2002-12-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* added SRAM class:
	   This is just a small helper class that offers loading and
	   saving of a byte-array. For the moment only MSXRom and MSXFmPac
	   use it. 
   
2002-12-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* added CRC16 routine, can be used by FDC / FDCBackends
	* fixed TC8566AF: completely forgot to send step/side/motor
	   commands to the DiskDrive

2002-11-30 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Still working towards raw track read

2002-11-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* fixed auto frameskip:
	   probably still needs some finetuning

2002-11-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed FDC bug (DriveMultiplexer)

2002-11-27 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Working towards raw track read

2002-11-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* FDC rewrite, introduced DiskDrive and DriveMultiplexer classes:
	   - this is a relatively large rewrite, so I may have broken
	     something. I wanted to commit rather soon, so I only tested
	     the Philips FDC.
	   - WD2793 Type I commands are now executed the same as in the
	     flowcharts of the technical datasheet (verify step not yet).
	   
2002-11-18 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* a small WD2793 update:
	   quick implementation of multi sector read
	   not tested and DSK backend needs to be changed
	   for correct behaviour!
	
2002-11-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Mapped TurboR keys to left and right windows key:
	   I haven't checked this, so possible I swapped left and right

2002-11-17 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* a few WD2793 updates (David please review):
	   MicrosolFDC partly works now: in BASIC the commands files load save
	   work, but starting a game from disk doesn't work.
	* converted "deinterlace" from a command to a setting:
	   - you should now use "set deinterlace [on|off]" instead of just
	     "deinterlace [on|off]"
	* converted "accuracy" from a command to a setting:
	   - you should now use "set accuracy [line|pixel|screen]" instead of
	     just "accuracy [line|pixel|screen]"

2002-11-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* renamed BrazilFDC to MicorsolFDC:
	   doesn't work yet, I'm investigating...
	* cleanups, small fixes in WD2793

2002-11-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented 'PUT KANJI acceleration' of S1985:
	   This fixes the font printing problem of the FS-4600F internal
	   software. AFAIK the FS-4600F now works completely (or at least
	   as good as NMS8250).
	   You need to add this to the FS-4600F config file:
	     <device id="S1985">
	       <type>S1985</type>
	     <device>

2002-11-11 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* National mapper type fixes:
	   - FS-4600F internal software seems to work, but I'm not certain
	     the 1st and 2nd menu option work as they should. Can someone
	     verify this?
	* Fixed National FDC

2002-11-11 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* completed timing in WD for writeTrack command:
	  Timing still needs some fine tunning, but not much
	* implemented writetrackdata in DSK backend:
	  Formatting with _format in BASIC seems to work
	  Need to compare with some real disks just to be sure.

2002-11-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* fixed PhilipsFDC: IDEFDISK doesn't coredump anymore
	* use old style file functions: should work with both old and new gcc

2002-11-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Improved scanline emulation: the dark line is now an interpolation of
	  the visible lines above and below.
	* Added horizontal blur: emulates the fact that MSX monitors and TVs
	  are not as sharp as typical PC monitors. Many game graphics are drawn
	  with this blurring in mind and look poor on a sharp display.
	Note: scanlines and blur are implemented only in the GL renderer.

2002-11-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* added VDP reset() methods (not finished)

2002-11-03 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Initial version of generic settings is working now.
	  Currently there is only 1 setting: scanline alpha.

2002-11-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* minor cleanups
	* fixed a few uninitialized variables:
	   - discoverd with valgrind
	   - some were harmless, fixed anyway to keep valgrind quiet

2002-11-02 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added two calls to the FDC backend:
	   These should later be used to enable the writeTrack command

2002-11-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Basic TC8566AF disk controller support (TurboR):
	   - Based on code from NLMSX written by Frits Hilderink
	   - TurboR boots now! It still has a lot of missing features though.

2002-11-01 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Scanline emulation in SDLGLRenderer.
	  Very rudimentary in this stage, but it works.

2002-10-31 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Changed SDLGLRenderer to make it a subclass of PixelRenderer.
	* Minor cleanups in SDLHiRenderer.

2002-10-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* rewrite of FDC infrastructure:
	   - the existing diskroms are too different to handle them all
	     in one class -> made FDCFactory that instantiates the right
	     object
	   - Implemented support for:
	       - Philips based diskroms: were already supported
	       - Brazil  based diskroms (needs better name?): IO-based
	           were already supported, but I never tested them
	           I also didn't test the new implementation
	       - National based diskroms (needs better name?):
	           also untested
	     The three diskroms above are all build around the WD2793 (or
	     compatible) controller.
	   - Configuration format changed slightly, see msxconfigFDC.xml
	     for details

2002-10-29 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Minor cleanups in PixelRenderer and SDLHiRenderer.

2002-10-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented mapper type "NATIONAL":
	   completely untested, will have to wait till this weekend

2002-10-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Replaced all file reading related classes with a new class
	  structure. This structure:
	   - has a simpler and more robust interface
	   - is easier to port(?)
	     a large part of the WIN32 patch deals with file reading stuff
	   - has real filetype separation: rom, disk, tape, config files have
	     their own searchpaths

2002-10-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "CartridgeSlotManager"

2002-10-25 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* "frameskip auto" completed

2002-10-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Cartridges are only inserted after configuration is parsed, this
	  allows in the future to have configurable cartridge slots
	* Added PANASONIC mapper type (for example used in Turbo-R for
	  MSX-VIEW ROM). Untested!!

2002-10-23 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed bug in sprite drawing of SDLLo.
	* Fixed bug in initialisation of horizontal adjust.
	* PixelRenderer now offers left border calculation to its subclasses.
	* Bug fixes and cleanups in coordinate calculation of
	  SDLHiRenderer::drawDisplay; SCREEN0 no longer fails the asserts.
	* Cleanups in SDLHiRenderer::drawSprites.
	  Should be applied to other Renderers as well.

2002-10-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Rewrite of "CommandLineParser":
	   - CLI options and CLI file types must be registered now, this allows
	     to move the implementation of, for example the "-fmpac" option, to
	     the MSXFmPac class where it belongs.
	   - This should keep the CLI more up to date with code changes and
	     make it easier to support new CLI options / file types.

2002-10-21 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* "frameskip auto" implementation started

2002-10-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Replaced "Simple64Kb" device with "RAM" device. This device also
	  supports random sizes, so it is possible to make 8Kb machines.

2002-10-20 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Moved subdivision of area-to-be-rendered from SDLHiRenderer to
	  PixelRenderer. Also changed subdivision approach: before, displayPhase
	  would draw display area and the borders; while the new drawDisplay only
	  draws the display area and all the border colour drawing is done by
	  drawBorder.

2002-10-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented frameskip command:
	   TODO "frameskip auto", skip frames depending on CPU speed

2002-10-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Some IDE fixes:
	    Harddisk works now! Following is still hardcoded:
	      master: harddisk, size 1GB filename "hd.dsk"
	      slave : not connected
	    I'll change this in the next couple of days

2002-10-16 Joost Yervante Damad <joost@lumatec.be>
	* removed compile-time disables for now

2002-10-13 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Moved absolute X coordinate to screen X coordinate translation from
	  PixelRenderer to SDLHiRenderer.

2002-10-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented Sunrise IDE interface:
	   only interface, no IDE devices yet
	* Implemented very simple IDE harddisk:
	   IDE-BIOS detects the disk
	      IDE Master:LBA,Mode 4:OPEN MSX HARD DISK
	      IDE Slave :not detected.
	   but the disk can't be used. Probably because the HD isn't
	   partioned yet.

2002-10-12 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Split off some functionality from SDLHiRenderer into new PixelRenderer.
	  PixelRenderer will contain the common code of the pixel-based
	  renderers (SDLHi, SDLLo, SDLGL).

2002-10-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed sound on high endian machines (untested)

2002-10-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Horizontal adjust is only updated the next scanline:
	   fixes some glitches in the "threedee rules" part of "relax"

2002-10-05 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	Last minute Bussum fixes:
	* Temporarily reverted name table base fix.
	  This fix needs modifications in the renderers as well and I don't have
	  time right now to find out exactly where.
	* Rewrote PhaseHandlers to specify rectangles in VDP absolute coordinates
	  and using exclusive limits.
	  Fixes crashes on MSX1 and excessive draws, maybe more.
	Unknown Reality shows only minor glitches, so we can demo with pride!

2002-10-03 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed bug in VDP: name table base was not adjusted for planar modes.
	  This caused wrong rendering in SCREEN7/8.
	* Disabled "inside window" check for now.
	  Parts of the code are not ready yet to use the VRAM windows properly.

2002-10-02 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.13.

2002-09-30 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* The Great VRAM Rewrite, part 4:
	  Introduction of VRAMObserver interface. Not used yet.
	* Minor VRAM cleanups.

2002-09-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Read/Write memory cache for SCC+
	* Unified Xanadu and Royal Blood mapper types

2002-09-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* SCC+ didn't work at all, fixed it.
	  Fixes Snatcher and SDSnatcher.
	* Fixed RoyalBlood mapper type (not sure about Xanadu)
	* Fixed Majutsushi, bad sound quality (DAC) though
	* Implemented CrossBlaim mapper type (untested)

2002-09-28 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.12.
	* I forgot that the cbios.xml used TMS99x8A.
	  With a V9938, C-BIOS can run many MSX2 ROMs as well.
	  I created two separate config files: cbios-msx1.xml and cbios-msx2.xml.

2002-09-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* GLFont uses 16x16 character texture instead of 256x1

2002-09-22 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.11.
	  Boukichi sure understands "release early; release often". :)

2002-09-20 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.10.

2002-09-17 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.08.

2002-09-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added "deinterlace" command:
	   switch at-run-time between stable and unstable interlace
	   only SDLHiRenderer and SDLGLRenderer

2002-09-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.07.

2002-09-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Enabled pixel accurate rendering in SDLHiRenderer:
	   - for some reason the NOTONLYSNESCANDOTHIS part in Unknown Reality
	     is not extremely slow (it is when using SDLGLRenderer)
	   - remember you have to manually enable pixel accurate rendering
	     with the command "accuracy pixel"
	* Enabled pixel accurate rendering in SDLLoRenderer

2002-09-08 Joost Yervante Damad <joost@lumatec.be>
	* mv configure.in -> configure.ac [autotools recommendation]
	* configure exits on failure to find SDL_image library

2002-09-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Correct blending in all non-paletted modes, no blending in
	  paletted modes
	* Implemented "accuracy" command. This allows to switch at-run-time
	  between pixel/line/screen accuracte rendering. For the moment
	  no screen accurate rendering and only for SDLGLRenderer.

2002-09-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Dont't stop when sound device couldn't be opened, just continue
	  without sound.

2002-09-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Added some Turbo-R specific devices:
	   - MSXTurboRPauze: without this BIOS gets stuck in pauze loop
	   - MSXS1990 (minimal): Needed to switch between Z80 / R800
	   - MSXF4Device (needs a better name): to distinguish between
	      cold/warm boot and Z80/R800 boot-pass
	   - MSXTurboRLeds
	  Turbo-R doesn't boot yet :-(

2002-09-01 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.06.

2002-08-31 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* The Great VRAM Rewrite, part 3:
	  SpriteChecker does all of its VRAM reading through VDPVRAM::Window.
	  Only CPU does non-windowed reads anymore.
	  All planar remapping occurs outside of VDPVRAM.

2002-08-31 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Move common code from SDLConsole and GLConsole to a new parent class
	* Added R800:
	   there is nothing implemented to switch from Z80 to R800, so for the
	   moment R800 is not yet usable

2002-08-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* SDLGLRenderer:
	   small cleanups
	   when interlaced, display odd fields half a line lower

2002-08-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* FDC supports 2 drives

2002-08-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented pixel-accurate rendering in SDLGLRenderer:
	   - scope part in Unknown Reality is correct now!
	   - some parts are _very_ slow now, implementation can still be
	     optimized a lot and speed should also improve when VDPVRAM
	     is finished.
	* Implemented "vdpregs" command to help vdp debugging

2002-08-26 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Updated C-BIOS to version 0.05.

2002-08-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented partial character rendering for SDLGLRenderer:
	   - fixes top border while vertical scrolling in Space Manbow
	   - fixes Psycho World
	* Implemented vertical scrolling in TextMode1 in SDLGLRenderer

2002-08-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Use SDL_image to load images (.png .bmp .jpg ...)
	* Implemented GLConsole for SDLGLRenderer
	    - old console didn't always work for SDLGLRenderer
	    - a lot faster
	    - per pixel alpha blending:
	       ConsoleBackground and ConsoleFont can be true RGBA images
	       (current pictures are .bmp, they don't have an alpha channel)

2002-08-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented R-Type mapper
	* Fixed vertical scrolling in text modes
	   (except TextMode1 in SDLGLRenderer)

2002-08-21 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added C-BIOS 0.04 to Contrib directory.
	* Added config XML for using C-BIOS to src/cfg.

2002-08-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* VDP code:
	   - trivial fixes / cleanups
	   - low resolution (SDLLo) rendering improvements
	     try SCREEN 0 WIDTH 80
	     only 24bpp modes yet
	* Z80 fix:
	   IFF2 should be reset while acknowledging an IRQ
	   this fixes music in "Break-In"

2002-08-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* major cleanups, minor tweaks / fixes

2002-08-16 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed wrong use of sizeof(array): it returns #bytes, not #elements.
	  Caused a segfault on Sparc.

2002-08-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Fixed SD-Snatcher loading bug:
	   - disk has a non-standard bootsector (sectors per track and number
	     of sides) is wrong. Updated heuristics to detect 9 sectors per
	     track and 2 sides in case disk image has 80*2*9 sectors.
	     How does the BDOS read this disk? Perhaps it uses the media
	     descriptor?

2002-08-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Split MSXMotherBoard in:
	   - MSXCPUInterface: handles communication between a MSXDevice and CPU
	        - registration of IO- and memory-space
	        - slotselection mechanism
	   - MSXMotherboard: keeps a list of all MSXDevices

2002-08-11 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* more Z80 cleanups
	* commands can now also be bound to key releases (was only keypresses)
	   example:  unbind F9
	             bind F9 "throttle off"
	             bind f9,up "throttle on"
	   this disables throttling while you hold F9 

2002-08-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Z80 fixes:
	   V_FLAG was wrong with SUB/SBC/CP instructions
	* Z80 fixes:
	   XF and YF flags where wrong with BIT n,r instruction
	* major Z80 cleanup:
	   - greatly reduced code duplication in CPUCore.n2

2002-08-09 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* More robust Thread class
	* cleanups, especially in JoyNet
	* fix bug [592594] MSXFDC doesn't work with single sided disks

2002-08-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Z80 cleanups / fixes:
	   especially fixes for the 2 undocumented flags (bit 3 and bit 5)
	* New config file format for inserted disks / tapes
	* Applied Manuel's patch [592591]:
	   romdb.xml is searched with FileOpener

2002-08-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Full support for .XSA disk images

2002-08-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Enabled SDLConsole in SDLGL renderer:
	   current code is only a temporary solution for the following reasons:
	    - use of SDL_OPENGLBLIT is heavily discouraged, see
	        http://www.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl/2001-November/039852.html
	    - transparancy doesn't work in 16-bit video modes
	      (an SDL limitation)
	   in the future we should make a native GLConsole

2002-08-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Allow multiple "md5" tags per "rom" tag
	* Low level tape support (experimental)

2002-08-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* wrote doc/commands.txt
	* cleanups, small fixes in RomTypes and MSXRom
	* added some entries in romdb.xml

2002-08-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* EmuTime cleanups:
	   introduced EmuDuration class
	    - the subtraction of 2 EmuTimes results in an EmuDuration,
	      this used to result in another EmuTime
	    - an EmuDuration can be added to / subtracted from an EmuTime,
	      this results in another EmuTime
	* DACSound:
	   - totally discarded old implementation
	   - new implementation is extremely simple, relatively slow, has
	     poor sound quality, but is bug free

2002-07-31 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Made "check-db":
	   a primitive tool to compare a romtype database against the build-in 
	   rom autodetection algorithm
	* When console is up, keypresses are blocked for MSX-Keyboard:
	   this implementation should work in all cases (hopefully)

2002-07-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* cleanups
	* Support for "ROM database"

2002-07-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Experimental support for .xsa disk images
	* Removed "automappertype" parameter, you can still explicitly specify
	  autodetection by setting "mappertype" to "auto"
	* Added MD5 class:
	   will be used for mappertype detection of difficult ROMs

2002-07-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added debug option NOTIME_EXECUTION, to make VDP command execute in
	  zero EmuTime. Useful for tracking "no/partial images" bugs.

2002-07-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* MSXDiskRomPatch supports 2 drives again

2002-07-22 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* The Great VRAM Rewrite, part 2:
	  SpriteChecker does most of its VRAM reading through VDPVRAM::Window.
	  Updated doc/vram-addressing.txt with details of sprite indexing.
	  Proper support for planar modes is still missing.

2002-07-21 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* The Great VRAM Rewrite, part 1:
	  Renderers do all their VRAM reading through VDPVRAM::Window now.
	  See doc/vram-addressing.txt for background info.

2002-07-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "bind" and "unbind" command

2002-07-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Moved event related files to new directory
	* Added Keys class:
	   translates keyCodes to keyNames and vice versa

2002-07-09 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Improved portbased interface to MSXFDC

2002-07-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Enabled console in SDLLoRenderer

2002-07-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Reenabled SDLLoRenderer:
	   - just a copy-paste from SDLHi and adjusted a few routines
	   - console is disabled in SDLLo
	   - not very well tested yet

2002-07-07 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added portbased interface to MSXFDC for Brazilian MSX's

2002-07-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Moved cassette related code to its own directory
	* Cleanups

2002-06-30 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added index mark to the FDC status register (not tested yet!)

2002-06-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Initial version of DiskImageManager (WIP):
	   - insert disk from commandline doesn't work yet
	   - MSXFDC compiles, but not yet tested
	   - MSXDiskROMPatch only supports 1 drive
	   - FDC_DSK backend only supports double sided disks
	* Insert disk from command line works again:
	   - just a hack, we need a better configuration format for this
	* MSXFDC still seems to work:
	  - config file changed slightly, see msxconfigFDC.xml
	  - David please check my modifications, especially the error
	    handling code

2002-06-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* MSXRom fix:
	   map 32kb ROMs in the right place

2002-06-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Small Mixer fix, cleanups

2002-06-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Enabled console background
	* Console font and background filename are read from config file

2002-06-20 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Moved thread related code to its own subdirectory
	* Added unregisterHotKey() and unregisterHotKeyCommand() methods
	* Enabled "renderer" command

2002-06-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Console commands and HotKeys are now executed by the main thread:
	   - this removes some (potential) races, so some bugs like
	       "This crashed once, but I can't reproduce it"
	     might be gone.
	   - this is a rather fundamental change, it might still contain some
	     glitches.
	* Removed all registerAsync__() methods:
	   they aren't used anymore and they shouldn't be in the future
	* Introduced condition variables (thread locking):
	   used in Scheduler to implement pause
	* Added unregisterEventListener() method

2002-06-18 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Basic timing for all FDC Type I commands

2002-06-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Tab-completion now works for zero-length tokens

2002-06-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Use exceptions for command error reporting

2002-06-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Simplified MSXRomPatchInterface

2002-06-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Scheduler fixes
	* Removed MSX16KB device:
	   MSXGameCartridge can do everything what MSX16KB could
	* Renamed:
	     MSXRom           -> MSXRomDevice
	     MSXGameCartridge -> MSXRom
	* Moved common code to MSXRomDevice
	* "filesize 0" no longer means autodetection, instead use
	  "filesize auto" (or just don't mention filesize)

2002-06-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* ConsoleCommand parser now understands quoted tokens or tokens with
	  escaped characters. Examples:
	      diska a\ space.dsk
	      diska "a space.dsk"
	      diska a\"quote.dsk
	  It should now be possible to enter any string as a command token.

2002-06-11 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* basic FDC fully working:
	   Fixed minor bug (all my tested disks work now)
	   Implemented small speed up

2002-06-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Commands can now be unregistered again
	* cleanups

2002-06-10 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* basic FDC implemenation partialy working:
	   DSK backend working
	   All Type I functions working
	   Type II partial (readSector OK, writeSector doesn't check for write
	   protected images yet)
	   No Type III commands yet

2002-06-06 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* First step towards an FDC implemenation:
	   Basic structure is provided
	   MSXFDC as good as finalized.

2002-06-05 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* preliminary auto* libpng support [David is learning auto* woowoo!]

2002-06-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@pi.be>
	* Implemented "speed" command, try "help speed" in console

2002-06-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* MSXGameCartridge cleanup

2002-05-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed PAINTER.ROM:
	   mappertype autodetection doesn't work, start with
	   ./openmsx roms/PAINTER.ROM,64kb
	* Fixed MSXSCCPlusCart:
	    delete SCC in destructor
	    ignore reads/writes outside address space

2002-05-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* writing the same value twice to an (output) connector doesn't change
	  the status of that connector, so don't call the write method of that
	  connector twice (Joystick, PrinterPort, Y8950Keyboard)

2002-05-23 Bas Wijnen <b.wijnen@student.rug.nl>
	* Mutexes added around PRT_* macros

2002-05-22 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* SDLGLRenderer uses block textures in Text1 (SCREEN0.40).
	* SDLGLRenderer uses block textures in Graphics2 (SCREEN2).
	* Rendering sprites in SDLGLRenderer is a lot faster now, because
	  textures aren't immediately destroyed after drawing.

2002-05-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* small sprite rendering optimizations

2002-05-18 Bas Wijnen <b.wijnen@student.rug.nl>
	* Added files for Xlib renderer. Mostly unimplemented.

2002-05-15 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* SDLGLRenderer uses textures.

2002-05-15 Bas Wijnen <b.wijnen@student.rug.nl>

	* fixed console-key-pass-bug and some minor things

2002-05-06 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Skeleton files for JoyNet configuration

2002-05-05 Bas Wijnen <b.wijnen@student.rug.nl>
	* Game Master 2 is working with SRAM and guessing.

2002-05-03 Bas Wijnen <b.wijnen@student.rug.nl>
	* Created src/FileType.hh for g++-3.0 and some g++-3.0 fixes

2002-05-02 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Calculate pixel precision coordinates.
	  They are approximately right, but not exactly right yet.

2002-05-02 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* File, HttpFile, LocalFile [work in progress]

2002-05-01 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Skeleton files for JoyNet device

2002-04-30 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* s/-fhuge-objects//g
	* verious g++-3.0 fixes

2002-04-29 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* SDLGLRenderer is working again.
	* SDLGLRenderer now uses CharacterConverter and BitmapConverter.
	* Removed double buffering from SDLHiRenderer. It didn't work and
	  without double buffering more optimisations are possible.
	* Renderers use screen position instead of EmuTime for internal update
	  targets. It was like this before the VDPVRAM introduction and with
	  the cleaned up implementation it is possible again.
	  It also fixes a bug where too many lines were scanline converted.
	  This caused no glitches, but it did waste CPU cycles.
	* Also made SpriteChecker use screen position rather than EmuTime.

2002-04-29 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* small cleanup FilePath [sorry guys!]
	* more proper cleanup

2002-04-28 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>

	* Removed re-entering of SpriteChecker::sync and Renderer::sync.
	  Display enable/disable changes now go through VDPVRAM.
	  Various other cleanups.
	  Most sprite glitches are fixed now.

2002-04-28 Bas Wijnen <b.wijnen@student.rug.nl>
	* Added includes, std:: prefixes and unsigned char casts
	  to allow compile with g++-3

2002-04-27 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Display mode changes now go through VDPVRAM.
	  It also performs planar reorder on single-byte reads and writes.

2002-04-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* VDP Text2 dirty colour table check

2002-04-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed a bug in SpriteChecker and also simplified it.

2002-04-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* more accurate VDP command timing:

2002-04-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Enabled VDP command timing:
	   recalculated table, no difference 50/60Hz anymore

2002-04-23 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Re-enabled SDLGLRenderer.

2002-04-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* tuned relative volume Y8950-ADPCM / -FM (thanks Manuel)

2002-04-18 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Separated sprite checking into a separate class.
	  Works, but with glitches.

2002-04-17 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* added tools/ dir and bin2c tool
	* added --disable-SCC
	* added --disable-FMPAC
	* added --disable-MSXMUSIC
	* more "--disable-XXX"'s to come ;-)

2002-04-16 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* More VDPVRAM and related cleanups.

2002-04-15 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Enhancements to the developpers FAQ

2002-04-15 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* extended commandline parser to support keyinserter

2002-04-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Extended KeyEventInserter so it can be used in Tilburg
	* Fixed YM2413 drums: playing the same drum twice now works

2002-04-13 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* VDPVRAM and related cleanups.

2002-04-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* DACSound cleanup (still has the same(?) bug)
	* EventDistributor simplification:
	   use Scheduler for synchronous event delivery
	   thanks Maarten for the idea
	* Made Scheduler thread safe
	* #include cleanups
	* Y8950 generates an IRQ on end-of-sample _in_EmuTime_ (was realtime)
	* Implemented Y8950 keyboard connector:
	   just the connector, no keyboard yet
	* More accurate ADPCM readback (thanks Maarten)

2002-04-11 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Royal blood works, use type ASCII8SRAM2!
	  Xanadu resets to Basic, Hydlide2 hangs.

2002-04-11 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Introduced "renderer" command to print current renderer and switch
	  to another one. However, switching from SDLHi to SDLGL hangs SDL.
	  Well, at least the renderer destructors are finally implemented.

2002-04-11 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Finally (?) fixed Y8950 samples:
	   "Arranger 4" sounds ok now
	* Implemented ADPCM readback (untested)

2002-04-11 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Royal blood works, use type ASCII8SRAM2!
	  Xanadu resets to Basic, Hydlide2 hangs.

2002-04-11 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added (not tested) support for ASCII8SRAM type to MSXGameCartridge.

	* Added support for Hydlide2 type to MSXGameCartridge.
	* Added generic support for SRAM to MSXGameCartridge.
	* Enhanced CommandLineParser to support SRAM filenames
	  for games.

2002-04-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Took character scanline conversion out of SDLHiRenderer as well,
	  its new home is a class called CharacterConverter.

2002-04-07 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Took bitmap scanline conversion out of SDLHiRenderer and put it in
	  a separate class called BitmapConverter.
	  It is necessary to reduce the size of SDLHiRenderer, because its
	  source had become too large to manage (over 1250 lines).

2002-04-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* small update to doc/developersFAQ.txt

2002-04-05 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* added --enable-interlacing ./configure argument
	  see also ./configure --help and src/config.h.in
	  after rerunning ./autogen.sh

2002-04-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Console cleanup
	* Console is no longer a singleton, instead there is now a singleton
	  ConsoleManager. All Consoles must register with the ConsoleManager.
	* Made InteractiveConsole subclass of Console:
	   SDLConsole inherit from InteractiveConsole
	   a logging-only console inherits from Console
	* Bumped version number
	* ConsoleFont.bmp can now be in any configured directory

2002-04-04 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added more debug info to MSXGameCartrdige.
	* Fixed an error in SCCplus cartridge
	* Addapted SCCplus cartridge to use FileOpener

2002-04-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Moved ADPCM part of Y8950 to its own file
	* Fixed ADPCM bug:
	   addresses where a factor 8 too low, only first sample was
	   played correctly
	* Made console command "fullscreen", PrtScrn is bound to this command
	* Console command "mute" takes on/off parameter
	* Console command "pause" takes on/off parameter
	* Made console command "console", F10 is bound to this command

2002-04-01 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* FileManager sync [WIP]
	* a first proposal for a FileManager API, I'll
	  implement it soon if noone objects [or at least
	  something like this!]

2002-03-31 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Cleaned up VRAM implementation a little.
	  Still plenty of work to be done.

2002-03-30 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added new VDPVRAM class, which manages VRAM.
	  It is far from finished, but even in the current state it should be
	  no less accurate than what we had before.

2002-03-30 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* made CommandlineParser xml entity safe

2002-03-28 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added MC6850 and sampleram to '-musmod' CLI option.
	* Added article written for the Dutch MSX-infoblad.
	  The png's are ment to be printed and where not scaled for
	  webpurposes.

2002-03-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Added dummy MC6850 (ACIA used in MSX Music Module for MIDI):
	   "FAC demo 3" now detects MSX Music Module

2002-03-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* amount of sample-ram is now configurable

2002-03-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented Y8950 timers
	* implemented "throttle" command

2002-03-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixed crash when a specified file did not exists:
	   for some reason C++ doesn't throw exception beyond the constructor,
	   even explicitly (re)throwing an exception in the constructor doesn't
	   work

2002-03-25 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* made VPATH compiles work, fixes 'make distcheck' also
	* bumped version no

2002-03-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented RYTHM sounds for Y8950 (MSX-AUDIO): untested!
	* reworked IRQ handling:
	    CPU keeps IRQStatus (was CPUInterface)
	    this way CPU can react directly on unannounced IRQs
	    (eg: Y8950 end-of-sample IRQ)

2002-03-24 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added more helptext to the CommandlineParser.
	* Made the 64 kB roms Manuel send me working.
	* Enhanced the autodection of MSXGameCartrdige.

2002-03-23 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* more CustomConfig framework
	* started on FilePath CustomConfig
	* this is WIP, and is not finished yet!

2002-03-21 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Again a (total) rewrite of CommandlineParser.
	  A simpler and cleaner design then the previous one, and
	  easy to extend for other CLI-options.

2002-03-20 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* XML::Escape support added to libxmlx
	* usage is explained in the header
	* if you make xml that is feeded into libxmlx,
	  you need to escape it first, to allow entity
	  escaping for &, <, >, ...
	* cleaned up libxmlx dir, libxmlx is now dual
	  licensed GPL and LGPL

2002-03-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* updated config files

2002-03-19 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>

	  Eggerland 2 works now, but is still autodetected incorrectly.

2002-03-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed tab completion bug
	* Fixed printed CPU T-States (only printed value was wrong)
	* Fixed crash when RTC.SAVE or FMPAC.PAC where missing

2002-03-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* convert CassettePort to Connector-Pluggable structure
	* MSXSimple:
	   - converted from MSXIODevice to PrinterPortDevice

	* Tab completion for help command
	* Fixed uninitialized variable (enabledSCC) in MSXGameCartridge
	* made MSXConfig::getParameterAsXXX() methods throw execptions again

2002-03-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Split Console in Console and CommandController:
	   commands can now execute without a Console
	* Implemented help command
	* Re-implemented tab-completion:
	   - completion till longest common match
	   - if there is only one match left a ' ' is added
	   - option for context sensitive completion (not yet tested)
	* Implemented tab completion for (un)plug command:
	   name of connector and pluggable gets completed

2002-03-07 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed Generic16K MegaROM mapper. DOS2 works now.

2002-03-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Added plug-connector infrastructure:
	   - only very basic support yet
	   - changed joystick stuff to use this

2002-03-07 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* New internal structure of CommandlineParser is working
	  This will make it possible to have extra parameters for
	  cartridges,disks, or in a more global context.
	* Small fix to MSXGameCartridge

2002-03-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* split console commands in tokens

2002-03-05 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* simplified auto* support for openGL
	  see src/config.h after running autogen.sh
	  to see which vars to use. For now it searches
	  for <gl.h> or <GL/gl.h> and for -lGL
	  This should allow easy conditional compile
	  of SDLGLRenderer.

2002-03-04 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added SDLGLRenderer (work in progress).
	* Added nms8250.xml to distributed files.

	* tightened interface in xmlx.hh
	* tiny configure.in fixes
	* bumped version number

2002-02-28 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed enlarged sprites. (David, you can fly your heli now! ;)

2002-02-28 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* moved sound related files to new directory "sound"

	  a real MSX-MUSIC is enabled on power-on

2002-02-27 Joost Yervante Damad <andete@worldcity.nl>
	* doxygen cleanups
	* updated homepage

2002-02-27 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed even/odd page flipping, it was overzealous.

	  doesn't work yet
	* for instructions, see README.WIN32
	* fixed faulty CHECK_FUNC in configure.in
	* atoll.c is now only used when needed

2002-02-25 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented even/odd and interlace display.

2002-02-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed port C read bug in PPI.
	  Now keyboard works in SBB promo and CAPS is off at boot time.
	* Implemented VDP name table masking (R#2) in bitmap modes.
	  The 12 scrolls part of the Source of Power works now.
	* Implemented blinking in Text2 display mode.
	* Disabled SDLLoRenderer for now; it is not actively maintained.

2002-02-23 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed Graphic7 border colour.

2002-02-22 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented VDP overscan.
	  Can use some more cleanup, but it works.

2002-02-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* PrinterPortDevice now receives EmuTime:
	   this is necessary for devices like Simple

2002-02-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* moved CPU related files to subdirectory

2002-02-18 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* added simple and a printerlogger.
	  Two devices that are connect to the printerport on a real MSX.
	  The first is a DAC to play samples, the other logs all the data
	  that a printer would normally print.

2002-02-17 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added atoll support for platforms that don't have
	  that function [code taken from newlib, a libc for
	  embedded systems]

2002-02-16 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Moved "display or border" calculation from renderer to VDP.
	  This is a preparation for overscan and for accurate VRAM timing.

2002-02-15 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Nicer mappertypes for the MSXGameCartridge:
	  As requested by Maarten you can now specify easier to remember
	  names (like ASCII8, SCC,KONAMI4,...) for the different mapper
	  types instead of the numbers.

2002-02-15 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added "palette" console command.

2002-02-15 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Nicer mappertypes for the MSXGameCartridge:
	  As requested by Maarten you can now specify easier to remember
	  names (like ASCII8, SCC,KONAMI4,...) for the different mapper
	  types instead of the numbers.

2002-02-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* CPU speedup:
	   CPU doesn't check the IRQ line after each instruction anymore, only
	   directly after synchronization points. This also means that all 
	   irq.set() instruction must also set a synchronization point.
	   TODO: check this for VDP, Y8950 and document this
	* VDP bug fix:
	   writes to register > 46 (non existing registers) overwrite other
	   variables

2002-02-13 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* MSX MUSIC/MSX AUDIO Stereo now possible:
	  The xml has an extra parameter allowing the Y8950 and YM2413 
	  to be activated in mono, left or right channel mode

2002-02-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed FM-modulation error in both Y8950 as YM2413

2002-02-11 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed some bugs in Y8950:
	   it is usable now, both OPL part as ADPCM part
	   but there are a few bugs left (YM2413 has the same problems)
	   relative volume of opl vs adpcm might need some tuning

2002-02-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Made "cpudebug" command:
	   must be enabled in CPU.hh (#define CPU_DEBUG)
	* Y8950 (AUDIO) updates
	* Implemented auto commands:
	   automatic joystick/mouse insertion is now possible

2002-02-10 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Moved SDL dependent code out of VDP:
	  - Renderer instantiation happens in PlatformFactory (new class)
	  - full screen toggle was moved to Renderer (not its final location)

2002-02-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed secondary slot select bug for real now.
	  The cause was uninitialised variables, the previous "fix" turned
	  out to be no more than a workaround.

2002-02-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Large Console cleanup:
	   convert code to C++
	   split code in SDL dependent and SDL independent part
	   moved all console code to directory ConsoleSource
	* Support for 9 joysticks
	* Stricter syntax checking for joyport command

2002-02-07 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed ASCII 16K (type 5) mapper.
	  Re-engineered Zanac-Ex ROM works now.
	* Made MSXMotherBoard console command inner classes private.

2002-02-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* More cleanups in ConsoleSource:
	   made SDLFont class, replaces DT_drawtext

2002-02-06 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* A few small fixes in joystick implementation.
	  It works now. Thanks Wouter!

2002-02-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Console cleanups
	* ConsoleCommand inner classes for Scheduler, MSXMotherBoard
	* Implemented "disk" command (similar as "tape" command):
	    works only for drive a:
	                   720kb disks
	* Implemented "joyport" command:
	    joyport[a|b] [unplug|mouse|joystick[1|2]]
	* First cleanup in ConsoleSource:
	   use hash_map in CON_consolecommand instead of self-made linked list

2002-02-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Implemented "reset" console command.

2002-02-05 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added MSXMotherBoard::IRQHelper class.
	* Removed IRQ helper functionality from MSXDevice.

2002-02-04 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Took advantage of new raiseIRQ/lowerIRQ semantics in VDP.

2002-02-04 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed bug where devices in non-expanded slots would only be
	  visible when subslot 0 was selected.
	* Implemented "slotselect" console command.

2002-02-03 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented "slotmap" console command.
	* Console::printOnConsole now accepts multi-line texts.
	* Fixed buffer overrun in CON_Out.
	* Renamed DummyDevice's device name to "empty", which makes
	  more sense to the user (who sees it in the slotmap).

2002-02-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Removed class LoadFile: it was only used by MSXRom and it was only
	  usefull for that class (two classes merged now)

2002-02-02 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented memory overlay behaviour in SCC page (0x3F).

2002-01-30 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* MSXTapePatch uses console:
	  Now possible to change or eject tapes using the console

2002-01-29 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Console enhancements:
	  -calls CommandHelp when tabcomplition has
	  already found a complete command
	* DiskPatch can now reports problems with disks during
	  initialization:
	  This should help Maarten if he has a 'black screen' :-)

2002-01-28 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* made libxmlx an 'utility' library, this implies that
	  openmsx links this statically, which makes for easier
	  debugging, no more 'wrapper script' for now

2002-01-27 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* Made SDL console autotools enabled

2002-01-26 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Console now usable:
	  - registered as ansynchron event listener
	  - Scheduler has now two commands registered

2002-01-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed double delivery of syncronous events

2002-01-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Exception cleanups
	* Y8950 adpcm support (untested)

2002-01-24 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added support for streamstring xml config per
	  request of David

2002-01-24 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Altered SDL_Console:
		- C++-ed the code and files
		- dumped unwanted function
		- now registers objects from type ConsoleInterface
		  to use for callback instead of C-function pointers
	* Scheduler has now one (1) registered command with console:
		- press tab for autocomplete :-)
	* Added cartridge to help debug ARC protection cartridge
	* DummyDevice warns about unregistered I/O port calls

2002-01-22 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added an SDL_console:
	  Not usefull for the moment but you can toggle it with F10
	  No commands possible and double key registration but the
	  effect is "cool" :-)

2002-01-20 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added DSKFMT-implementationr:.
	  Formating of a 360kB dsk file doens't work. A 720kB dsk file
	  can be formated single or double sided.
	* Autofill of empty,newly generated .dskfiles:
	  No auto formating however, maybe later.

2002-01-19 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* openmsx now uses new config code
	* features:
		- supports multiple config files
		- it's possible to create alternative config backends
		- no more libxml++ *yipee*
		- uses libxmlx, right now still linked dynamically,
		  this means that ./openmsx is actually a libtool provided
		  script, soo for debugging use .libs/openmsx and alter
		  the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable if needed
		- support for save not yet added, but it will be easy
	* xmlconfig raises exception on duplicate "id"

2002-01-12 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Compile fix for Thread class:
	  explicitly convert between Runnable pointer and void pointer.

2002-01-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made a Thread class, interface is SDL independent,
	  implemenation uses SDL
	* made a Mutex class, analog as Thread
	* sync MSX-MUSIC and MSX-AUDIO on register write
	* made all sound related classes (except Mixer) SDL independent

2002-01-11 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Implemented RTC load/save on power on/off
	  (this is not the same as saveState)
	* Implemented FMPAC-SRAM load/save on power on/off

2002-01-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* MSXMemoryMapper <-> MSXMapperIO cleanup (thanks Maarten)

2002-01-10 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added FileOpener. This implements the needed routines to
	  support "rompaths". It also provides easy to use functions
	  to open files in the other devices.

2002-01-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* VR resets one line before start of display.
	  Fixes Almost Real Copper Bars part.

2002-01-09 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Prepared CPU and Z80 class for inclusion of R800:
	   - moved as much code as possible from Z80 to CPU
	   - separated timimg dependent code from the rest of the code
	   - ugly "#inlude-hack" to avoid the overhead of virtual functions

2002-01-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed MSXMemoryMapper so that it can handle over 64K of memory.

2002-01-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Red and green were swapped in Graphic7 rendering.
	* Apply planar reorder also on CPU reading VRAM and sprite checking.
	  Fixes Hydefos intro, all Graphic6/7 rendering should be OK now.

2002-01-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Preliminary Graphic6/7 rendering.
	  Works somewhat, but not in all cases.
	* Fixed transparency bug; Psycho World sky is blue again.

2002-01-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* DiskRomPatch cleanup: I wanted to fix the PHYDIO routine, but it
	  was already correct (the result in the B register). Maybe it is
	  now more obviously correct?

2002-01-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80: fixed HALT instruction (rounding error)
	* more #include cleanups
	* getCPURegs() interface cleanup

2002-01-06 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented rendered line caching in bitmap modes (SDLHi).
	* Fixed GETDPB in MSXDiskRomPatch: uses static table based on passed
	  media descriptor instead using values from boot sector.

2002-01-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80: reverted buggy optimization,
	  fixes undeadline, track&field, flickering in space manbow

2002-01-06 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* small fixes
	* XMLConfig skeleton + some code

2002-01-06 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Text mode extra-wide border now drawn at once (SDLHi).

2002-01-05 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented CC and IC bits of sprite mode 2.
	  Now OR-ed sprite patterns are rendered as they should.

2002-01-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* #include cleanup
	* Changed PSG mute routine:
	  PSG-samples in "time curb" now work!

2002-01-05 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* small libxmlx improvements
		- should handle comments and pcdata correctly
		- started modifications of msxconfig code, first in
		  a seperate temporarely program cfgtest, to avoid
		  hindering the other coders

2002-01-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Changed interaction Mixer-SoundDevice:
	  Mixer now calls the updateBuffer() method of each SoundDevice, even
	  if device is muted (device can update internal counter). If the
	  device was muted is must return a null-pointer.

2002-01-03 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* SDLHiRenderer needs to sync on VRAM updates after all.
	  This solves the disappearing boss blocks of Knightmare stage 1.
	* The VDP (sprite checking) needs to sync on VRAM updates as well.
	  Hopefully this will solve the Knightmare stage 2 boss problem.

2002-01-03 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* libxmlx sync

2002-01-03 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Improved tape support, tested with Time_Curb.cas file

2002-01-03 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Changed pause implementation in Scheduler to make it thread safe.
	* Fixed PAL timing in SDLHiRenderer.

2002-01-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* RealTime syncronizer improvements

2002-01-02 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added tape support, not yet tested
	* Restored old filesize behaviour in gamecartridge

2002-01-02 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Improved VDP accuracy.
	  Space Manbow still flashes, but less than before.

2001-12-31 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* SDLHiRenderer uses double buffering.
	* Prepared SDLHiRenderer for RealTime sync, but if I enable it the
	  emulated MSX slows down (even though host CPU load remains low).
	* Added FDC values as patches to nms8250.xml, fixes disk ROM hang.

2001-12-31 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* lots of small C++ standard compliancy fixes
	* Z80Core.hh -> Z80Core.nn
	* more disk support, still partially works only
	* disk support now works completely, but not yet
	  for all programs [starquake, on mania036.dsk
	  works completely]
	* fixes for slotselection [thanks Maarten]

2001-12-31 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Render accuracy is now one line instead of one frame.
	* Implemented line interrupt (horizontal scanning interrupt).
	  Timing is still a bit off though.
	* Implemented horizontal display adjust (vertical not yet).
	* Implemented HR/VR status bits.
	* Prepared for caching of rendered lines in bitmap modes.
	* Command engine cleanups.

2001-12-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80: correct inter-instruction timing for DDCB and FDCB instrcutions,

2001-12-30 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* more disk support, it already works a little bit,
	  but the slot switching still needs to be added

2001-12-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Memory reads/writes can now be cached (if possible)
	  measured 10% - 20% performance gain
	  not completely finished, especially documentation

2001-12-29 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* synced in libxmlx skeleton [W.I.P.!]
	* header file include cleanup, this should avoid alot
	  of useless recompilation

2001-12-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Scheduler now uses a heap instead of sorted set
	* SyncPoints can now be removed
	* SyncPoints take an optional userData parameter, this parameter
	  is later passed to executeUntilEmuTime() method
	* MSXDevice does not inherit from Schedulable anymore, devices that
	  still need to be Schedulable must inherit itself from Schedulable
	  (eg VDP)

2001-12-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added getCPURegs() and setCPURegs() methods in class CPU

2001-12-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* small optimization in Scheduler:
	  no overhead when unpaused

2001-12-25 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added --enable-profile and --enable-release to ./configure
	* added "debug" and "nodebug" targets to Makefile in src dir [toggle]
	  usage: "make debug" turns on debug for this and next makes
	         "make nodebug" turns it of again

2001-12-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added "unsigned" to uint64 definition in Scheduler.
	  Before, Scheduler::INFINITY was -1.
	* Implemented PAL at 50Hz and NTSC at 60Hz.
	* Restructured VDP timing routines.

2001-12-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added render routine for Graphic4 mode.
	* Added support for 212 lines display.
	* Added partial sprite mode 2 implementation.

2001-12-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added render routine for Graphic5 mode.
	* Added support for transparency control (R#8 bit 5).

2001-12-24 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Finished integration of command engine.
	  It runs, but without render routines for the bitmap modes,
	  it is not possible to visually check the results.

2001-12-23 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed a design flaw in the Renderer interface.
	  The update methods were called *after* the changed VDP state
	  became effective. That way, delayed rendering operations cannot
	  be completed because the old VDP state is no longer available.
	  In the new interface, update methods are called *before* the
	  new state becomes effective. So the old values can be retrieved
	  from the VDP, while the new values are passed as parameters
	  of the update method.

2001-12-22 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed dirty check bugs.
	  The "inside name/colour/pattern table" checks were wrong:
	  too much was considered inside, therefore too many characters
	  were considered dirty.
	  Also the attempt to make Text2 use the same dirty checking code
	  as the MSX1 display modes failed, instead I wrote different
	  dirty checkers for different display modes. This was bound to
	  happen in the future anyway, because bitmap modes will require
	  different dirty checks than pattern modes.

2001-12-22 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added VDP Command Engine 1.0 from Alex Wulms.
	  Adapted the code to C++ and to openMSX conventions.
	  Only functional change is SCREEN7/8 pixel lookups (two defines).
	  The command engine compiles and links, but cannot run yet.

2001-12-21 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented Text2 display mode (SCREEN0.80).
	* Prepared for blinking (not finished yet).

2001-12-21 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Applied gamma correction to V9938/58 palette.
	  My guess is that the gamma of MSX and PC monitors is slightly
	  different; the palette precalc now compensates for that.

2001-12-21 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented palette feature of V9938/58.
	  Can be seen by running Nemesis 3 using NMS8250 config.

2001-12-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed uninitialized variable in RP5C01:
	  this caused a delay of several seconds at start-up

2001-12-20 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added MSX-AUDIO: no ADPCM yet, not optimized
	* LoadFile and MSXGameCartridge cleanup

2001-12-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Removed more indirections from YM2413

2001-12-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixed CassettePort: 
	  exceptions don't work if you compile with -fno-rtti, removed it

2001-12-18 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* MapperType guesser can be turned on/off
	* MapperType now configurable in MSXGameCartrdige.
	* Integrated MSXKonamiSynthesizer into MSXGameCartrdige.

2001-12-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* sound on/off (F11) and pause (PAUSE) now work together
	* fixed "pure virtual function called" error

2001-12-16 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Extende LoadFile to autodetermine file-size.
	* Renamed MSXMegaRom to MSXGameCartrdige.
	* MSXGameCartridge can now handle smaller game roms (<= 64kB)

2001-12-15 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added volume to the SCC.
	* Used F11 as HotKey to sound on/off:

2001-12-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Fixed DACSound, KeyClick now works

2001-12-11 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Optimised MSX-MUSIC mixing.
	* Removed indirection on ch array ("Channel *" -> "Channel).

2001-12-12 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* Added the SCC+ cartridge

2001-12-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Cleanup MSXMusic / MSXFmPac:
	   "CALL FMPAC" now works!

2001-12-11 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Compacted the SCC mixing and muting code.
	* Added offset to lookups in SCC::getFreqVol.
	* SCC::ch_enable is not masked upon write.
	* Added "currentChipMode = chip" to SCC::setChipMode.
	* Changed size of waveform array to 32 (was 64).

2001-12-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Implemented Z80 inter-instruction-timing
	   (DD CB instructions not correct yet)

2001-12-11 David Heremans
	* uploaded SCC soundchip:
	  This chip can emulate the SCC hardware in the 3 know modes
	   - Real SCC
	   - SCC+ cartridge in SCC compatible mode
	   - SCC+ cartridge in SCC+ mode
	* Changed MegaRom:
	  Megarom of type 2 know use the SCC soundchip.

2001-12-10 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Implemented indirect register write for V9938/58.
	* V9938/58 can now have 16K, 64K or 128K of VRAM.
	* Upgraded CPU interface to read/write more than 16K of VRAM.
	* Changed video mode naming scheme to match V9938 data book.

2001-12-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Cleanups in MSXMemoryMapper, requires config file change
	* More config file changes:
	    PSG   -> volume parameter
	    MUSIC -> volume parameter
	    PPI   -> volume parameter
	          -> key_ghosting parameter
	    Mixer -> frequency parameter
	          -> samples parameter
	* RealTime cleanups:
	   - MSXRealTime renamed to RealTime
	   - RealTime is no longer a MSXDevice
	   - moved parameters to config file

2001-12-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Faked enough V9938 features to make nms8250.xml boot.

2001-12-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed compilation with Z80DEBUG enabled.
	* Fixed single-width pixels in SCREEN0 in SDLHiRenderer.
	* Re-enabled resetting of dirty flags at end-of-frame.
	  This was probably disabled during debugging and accidentally
	  commited to CVS.

2001-12-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Introduced VDP class, which will replace MSXTMS9928a.

2001-12-09 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* Rom Patching Code skeleton
	* MSXDiskRomPatch skeleton

2001-12-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed uninitialised struct field in SDLLoRenderer.
	* SDLHiRenderer renders doubled pixels now.

2001-12-09 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Introduced SDLHiRenderer.
	  Opens 640x480 screen, although it still renders low-res.
	* Changed configuration:
	  - new category: "renderer"
	    type selects renderer: "SDLLo" or "SDLHi"
	  - "fullscreen" moved to "renderer" and renamed "full_screen"
	    plus it's an actual boolean now
	  - new parameter: "limit_sprites" in "msx1vdp"
	* Setting "limit_sprites" to false actually works now.

2001-12-08 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Improved Doxygen comments in MSXTMS9928a and Renderer.
	* Small optimisations in sprite rendering.
	* Renamed XPal to Pal: it hasn't been X for quite some time.
	* Introduced sprite buffering: VDP stores sprite info for one
	  frame, so Renderer can retrieve it on demand. This removes
	  the need for the Renderer to call checkSprites, making the
	  VDP behaviour completely independant of the Renderer used.

2001-12-08 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* Loadfile now handles patching of files

2001-12-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added several missing reset() calls

2001-12-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* MSXPPI is no longer a singleton

2001-12-06 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Small initialisation fix in MSXTMS9928a.
	  Thanks to Wouter for spotting the problem.

2001-12-06 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* removed init() method from MSXDevice:
	  initialization should be done in the constructor
	* all MSXDevice constructors (former init() methods) now take an
	  EmuTime parameter

2001-12-05 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* MSXRom continued [reworked, no longer inherited from MSXDevice]

2001-12-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Made MSXIODevice and MSXMemDevice both subclasses of MSXDevice:
	  these 2 classes take functionality away from MSXDevice and put it
	  in more specialized classes. They also offer things like automatic
	  slot-registration (and in the future automatic IO-registration)
	* removed start() and stop() methods from MSXDevice
	* reset() method in MSXDevice now takes an EmuTime argument

2001-12-04 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added MSXRom subclass and LoadFile mixin, as first step
	  towards ROM patching support

2001-12-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* correct use of register 0x7ff6 for MSX-MUSIC
	* MSXMotherBoard is no longer a MSXDevice

2001-12-03 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* fixed Config *getConfigById(const std::string &type)
	* started on disk support "level 2" [not in CVS yet]

2001-12-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Made a new EmuTime class (for details search mailarchives for
	   "[RFC] new EmuTiem class"). This gave a large performance gain,
	   more than I had hoped for.
	* SoundDevices now unregister themself before destruction

2001-12-02 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Integrated name/pattern/colour table base addresses and mask
	  into a single mask. This is probably how the hardware does it.
	* Fixed dirty checks.
	  King's Valley 2 is now actually fixed, blanking just happened
	  to make the problem go away without fixing the bug causing it.
	* Moved to "pull" model for VDP - Renderer communication:
	  VDP sends update signals when parts of its state change,
	  Renderer can get current state from VDP at all times.

2001-12-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixed pause:
	   - <F12> now works when paused
	   - after pause emulation isn't too fast
	* correct inline in Z80
	* MSXMegaRom cleanup, minor speedup

2001-12-01 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed compile error in CassettePlayer.cc:
	  PRT_ERROR contains exit(), which needs <stdlib.h>.

2001-12-01 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Fixed bug which caused Z80 to fail when methods were not inlined.
	  Problem was that ld_xix_byte() and ld_xiy_byte() called Z80_WRMEM
	  with two parameters, each of which read an opcode, an operation
	  which increases the program counter. This is wrong because the
	  evaluation order of parameters is not guaranteed.

2001-12-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added FM-PAC
	* MSXMotherBoard is now also a CPUInterface, this eliminates one
	  indirection in readMem()-like methods but these get called a few
	  100 000 times a second. I measured 10%-20% performance gain

2001-11-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made a helper function registerSlots()
	* made a helper function loadFile()
	   note: config file format changed!

2001-11-29 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Added a CassettePlayer (no record function yet)
	  A CassettePlayer must be plugged into the CassettePort and
	  you must insert a tape (= .wav file) into the CassettePlayer
	  Currently you can't do either of these operations.

2001-11-27 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Added updateBlanking to Renderer interface.
	  Fixes redraw problem in King's Valley 2.
	* Various cleanups in MSXTMS9928a and SDLLoRenderer.

2001-11-26 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Introduced SpriteInfo in MSXTMS9928a, this is a prelude to
	  sprite info buffering (separating calculation time from
	  rendering time).
	* Introduced VdpVersion enum in MSXTMS9928a.

2001-11-20 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Small CassettePort update, implemented very primitive filter

2001-11-25 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Sprites are now rendered in the screen buffer rather than in the
	  display cache (which replaced "canvas"). As a result, sprite drawing
	  code became simpler and the display cache needs less updates.

2001-11-25 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Render on demand:
	  New Renderer can render as many lines as requested.
	  Many lines at once has lower overhead, but if necessary it
	  can still render one line at a time.
	  This code can be converted to pixel-precision rendering that
	  has decent performance.
	* All change tracking (dirty flags etc) is moved to Renderer.
	* Interface between VDP and Renderer is much cleaner now.
	  (no more public fields)
	* Got rid of "tms" struct.

2001-11-20 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added basic support for CassettePort
	   - CassettePort has no filters yet
	   - no output (record) yet
	   - !! no CassttePlayer (must be plugged in a CassettePort) !!

2001-11-18 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* The drawing area (now called "canvas") is now an off-screen SDL
	  surface instead of a pixel array. SDL calls are for blitting and
	  drawing empty lines (top and bottom border).
	* Cleanup of change tracking in VDP.
	* Cleanup of Renderer access to VDP state:
	  public fields replaced by inline methods.
	* Cleanup of VDP fields: slowly getting rid of "tms" struct.

2001-11-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* updated KeyEventInserter, it works now but it is not yet useable,
	  needs to read text from config file or something

2001-11-17 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* MSXTMS9928a and SDLLoRenderer respect SIZEOF_BOOL now.
	* Introduced Renderer: pure abstract superclass to all renderers.
	* Changed SDLLoRenderer into a template class.
	  All supported colour depths are compiled in.
	  A factory method selects a suitable colour depth automatically.

2001-11-17 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added sizeof(bool) autoconf macro
	* rearranged configure.in to avoid problems
	  with simple checks being confused by the extra
	  CXXFLAGS and libs

2001-11-17 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* SDLRenderer is now SDLLoRenderer (low-res: 320x240) and
	  was given its own files.
	  Also removed MESS history comments from MSXTMS9928a.

2001-11-16 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Split off SDLRenderer from MSXTMS9928a.
	  This makes it easier to support different renderers
	  (320x240, 640x480, 8/16/32bpp).
	  In the near future SDLRenderer will get its own file.

2001-11-16 Maarten ter Huurne <mth@stack.nl>
	* Disabled 512K mapper in cfg/someconfig.xml because it conflicted
	  with the MegaROM.

2001-11-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* cleanup EventDistributor/HotKey

2001-11-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80: interrupt state is only checked right after a sync point
	       halt now "burns" CPU cycles
	    --> large CPU speedup

2001-11-14 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* an MSXDevice is now associated with an MSXConfig object as soon as
	  it is instantiated. Before this change it was possible that a
	  MSXDevice (mostly singletons) was used before it could access its
	  parameters.
	* AY8910: fixed uninitialized variables

2001-11-13 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixed HotKey: method find() returns a normal iterator, not an
	   iterator that goes over elements that match the search criteria

2001-11-13 David Heremans
	* openMSX now stops when using the WM close button:
	* Correct close behaviour:
	    Set a sync point so that if the CPU is scheduled until
	    infinite we still can stop openMSX.
	    Wouter will look into the HotKey event distribution,
	    it is temporarly fixed using if comands.


2001-11-09 David Heremans
	* quickly add a fullscreen flag in the TMS code:
	    extra parameter in config.xml file
	    use PrintScreen key to togle
	* openMSX now stops when pressing F12:
	    however make sure that openMSx is full screen when you press F12

2001-11-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* reworked CPU related classes:
	    much simpler structure
	    more optimizations possible in the future
	* Z80: correct wait-state handling

2001-11-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80: undocumented instructions like "res 4,(ix+5),b" implemented
	* Z80: correct(?) timing for undocumented instructions

2001-11-04 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80 cleanup/fixes:
	  fixed DAA instruction, bug in Penguin Adventure should be fixed now
	  correct 'undocumented-flag-handling' for most instruction

2001-10-31 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixed bug in Z80, some instruction had a negative T-State count!!
	  Road Fighter works again

2001-10-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added MSX-MUSIC, code largly taken from Mitsutaka Okazaki
		http://www.angel.ne.jp/~okazaki/ym2413/
	  no "suspend" function yet

2001-10-29 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* finished migration of CVS and mailinglists to sf.net
	* thank you sourceforge team!!
	* http://openmsx.sf.net

2001-10-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixes, improvements to DACSound (untested)
	* updated KeyClick, the "click too short" problem should be solved now
	  KeyClick now uses a DACSound object to play sound, playing samples
	  on KeyClick should also be possible now (untested)
	* pause sound while pause emulation
	* SoundDevices default now to muted after creation, fixes a race in
	  Mixer::registerSound()

2001-10-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* SoundDevices can now mute themselves, mixer doesn't ask
	  for soundbuffer of muted devices
	* added KeyClick support, PPI had to be made time aware for this
	  doesn't work very well yet because a typical key-click-spike
	  takes about 34us which is shorter than the duration of 1 sample

2001-10-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* make DACSound compile again (doesn't work yet)
	* add HotKey service
	* openMSX can be paused (pause key), added to demonstrate the
	  use of HotKey. Problems with current pause implementation:
	    - sound must also be paused
	    - realtime keeps running, so after unpausing openMSX 
	      tries to catch up and runs too fast for a while
	* MSXKanji now supports both class 1 as class 2 Kanji
	* Added MSXPrinterPort and DummyPrinterPortDevice (= no device
	  connected)

2001-10-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Changed Mixer and SoundDevice interface (David's request).
	  Now each SoundDevice must do its own buffer-managment, this gives
	  more flexibility to devices like DAC's

2001-10-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* small performance improvement in MSXZ80

2001-10-21 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added some basic conversions to MSXConfig##Device
	  let me know when more are needed
	* updated msxconfig.dtd to reflect soon te be added
	  non-device configuration entries
	* added support for non-device configuration entries
	  this is not thoroughly tested, but should work

2001-10-19 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* started TODO file to collect ideas/things todo

2001-10-19 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* documented SoundDevice interface on David's request
	* RP5C01 can now optionally sync with host-clock, but this 
	  limitates some functionality

2001-10-18 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented test register in RP5C01,
	  corrected 12/24 hour mode, month-wrap-bug fixed
	* RP5C01 is now emutime synced instead of realtime

2001-10-17 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added src/cfg dir for storing config file templates
	* started in KeyEventInserter

2001-10-17 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made improvements to MSXRealtime
	* small fixes to MemoryMapper, E6Timer
	* improvements to RP5C01 (RTC)

2001-10-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* fixed bug in Keyboard (uninitialized variable)
	  and made minor performance improvement in keyGhosting
	* add 1 extra waitState after each instruction
	* Corrected MSXRealTime, speed is now correct. Deviation was
	  caused by accumulation of rounding errors. 

2001-10-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Scheduler can now schedule "Schedulable" objects instead of
	  only MSXDevices, this is necessary for sub-device scheduling
	  (e.g. counters in I8254

2001-10-15 Marcel Harkema <marcel@qahwah.net>
	* * Set the MAINTAINERCLEANFILES variable in Makefile.am files
	  (for make maintainer-clean)
	* * EventDistributor.hh should include <map> and not <multimap.h>
	  (which is an internal header file)
	* * Add {XML,SDL}_CFLAGS, {XML,SDL}_LIBS, etc. to CXXFLAGS and
	  LIBS in configure.in (and remove openmsx_LDADD line from
	  src/Makefile.am)
	* Include <cassert>, <cstdio>, etc. instead of <assert.h>, 
	  <stdio.h>, .. [I might have missed some... please check your
	  code]
	* [patch applied by joost]

2001-10-14 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* Made EmuTime printable [read streamable] for David

2001-10-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Simplified MSXRealTime implementation

2001-10-11 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* MSXTMS9928a and MSXRealTime updates

2001-10-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* update parts of audio-buffer when registers have changed
	* fixed tone generation in AY8910 (overflow in calculation)

2001-10-09 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* removed all automake/autoconf utility files,
	  use autogen.sh to install them locally

2001-10-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added a real time synchronizer (MSXRealTime)
	* fixed keyGhosting bugs in Keyboard

2001-10-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* renamed Inputs --> Keyboard
	* forgot to initialize keyboard matrix
	* moved method keyGhosting() from MSXPPI to Keyboard
	  --> method is now only called when 
	        * keymatrix has changed and
	        * keymatrix is read
	* extended Mixer to support (pseudo)stereo

2001-10-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Made a very simple mixer, made AY8910 register itself as 
	  sound generator.

2001-10-03 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* updated automake utility files

2001-10-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* "static const int -> enum" cleanup
	* Reworked EventDistributor, it is now possible to deliver events
	  synchronously and asynchronously. This makes the EventDistributor
	  more complex, but it eliminates locking problems in synchronous
	  ( = almost all) client code.

2001-10-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made Philips mapper-IO behaviour
	* read mapper behaviour from config file, this needed some
	  restructuring in MapperIO and related classes
	* Fixed TurboR ST mapperIO

2001-10-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80 converted to a C++ class, still needs cleanups
	* IRQ handling cleanup

2001-09-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* second part of Z80 cleanup 

2001-09-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* #define -> static const int   cleanup
	* first part of Z80 cleanup

2001-09-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* reimplemented Scheduler, total new algorithm
	* made some changes to cpu-device's
	  these need some cleanup, especially the c/c++ mix (Z80)

2001-09-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added locking to class EventDistributor (maybe std::multimap is
	  thread-safe and no locking is necessary)
	* added locking to class Mouse, there was a small race that could cause
	  some mouse-movement-glitches

2001-09-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented Real Time Clock device
	* implemented joystick support. Cannot be used yet since there is no
	  mechanism to plug a Joystick in a joystickPort yet (dynamically nor
	  statically)
	* implemented mouse support. Cannot be used yet, same reason as above

2001-09-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made sperate thread for event handler
	  other classes can ask EventDistributor to receive specific events
	* adapted Inputs for new event model
	* respond to SDL_QUIT event

2001-09-23 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	*  various small fixes
	* started working on making the code work with gcc-3.0
	* added autogen.sh: use to regenerate build files
	* added m4/ dir for own autoconf m4 macros
	* added fstream_templ.m4, since in gcc-3.0 ifstream
	  is templatized on type, and .read() returns char,
	  not unsigned char, soo this needs ifstream<byte> in
	  openmsx, but in gcc-2.95 ifstream is not a template.
	* added -fno-rtti to compile-flags since we don't use
	  runtime type inspection anyway, and it increases binary size
	  see also: http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2000-03/msg00064.html

2001-09-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* cleanups in most devices
	* small bug fixes in some devices
	* Implemented memory mapper
	  all mappers share one MapperIO device
	  reading from mapper ports can be customized

2001-09-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80/R800 separation cleaned up:
	  only the class MSXCPU knows there are 2 CPU's, all other devices
	  should talk to MSXCPU instead of MSXZ80 or MSXR800 (nor ask
	  MSXMotherBoard which CPU to talk to)
	  Removed some code marked as "ugly hack"
	* added support for Kanji ROM
	* cleanups in MSXRom16KB 

2001-09-19 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* various small fixes around the code
	* the 16k rom still needs a C++ makeover

2001-09-17 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented kana/code led
	* implemented joystick-ports. This is only the port, not the devices
	  that can be plugged into the port (joystick, mouse, ...)
	* interupt handling was seriously broken (CPU jumped to 0x38 at every
	  di->ei transition even when there was no device that had raised an IRQ)
	  Fixed now (I think). Also moved interrupt related methods from class
	  Scheduler to class MSXMotherBoard.

2001-09-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented sound generation for PSG (code taken from xmame-0.37b)
	  mixer is not finished, so you won't hear anything yet

2001-09-16 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added endian-ness check to configure.in
	* removed -DLDB_FIRST, and made it dependant on
	  configure result
	* added sizeof long autoconf check, to make Z80.cc
	  also work correctly on 64 bit and 128 bit cpu's [untested]

2001-09-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* started implemention of MSXPSG (no sound generation yet)

2001-09-15 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* reworked msxconfig.cc by using the xmlhelper
	* xmlhelper is a simplified xml interface

2001-09-13 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added xmlhelper class, which I will start using
	  to make xmlconfig code cleaner
	* made msxconfig more standards-compliant

2001-09-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* removed double initialization
	* CPU is no longer a special case with initialization
	* fixed various bugs
	* made Inputs independent from MSXPPI
	* implemented CAPS LED + support for all other LEDs

2001-09-09 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* print more usefull debug messages
	* use DummyDevice instead of the general MSXDevice for all the
	  emptyDevice's
	* registering SP must be done by Scheduler, not Motherboard

2001-09-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>

	* started integrating SDL keys
	* VDP integration Sean's code started
	* subslot selecting and mainslot selecting imped
	* MSXMotherboard slotlayout filled with dummy
	  empty devices to avoid 0-pointers

2001-09-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* In class Scheduler, use "set" instead of "list" or "sortedlist"
	* Split MSXPPI in a MSX depended part and a reuseable 8255 part

2001-08-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
