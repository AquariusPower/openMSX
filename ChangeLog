2001-10-09 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* removed all automake/autoconf utility files,
	  use autogen.sh to install them locally

2001-10-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added a real time synchronizer (MSXRealTime)
	* fixed keyGhosting bugs in Keyboard

2001-10-07 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* renamed Inputs --> Keyboard
	* forgot to initialize keyboard matrix
	* moved method keyGhosting() from MSXPPI to Keyboard
	  --> method is now only called when 
	        * keymatrix has changed and
	        * keymatrix is read
	* extended Mixer to support (pseudo)stereo

2001-10-05 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Made a very simple mixer, made AY8910 register itself as 
	  sound generator.

2001-10-03 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* updated automake utility files

2001-10-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* "static const int -> enum" cleanup
	* Reworked EventDistributor, it is now possible to deliver events
	  synchronously and asynchronously. This makes the EventDistributor
	  more complex, but it eliminates locking problems in synchronous 
	  ( = almost all) client code.

2001-10-02 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made Philips mapper-IO behaviour
	* read mapper behaviour from config file, this needed some
	  restructuring in MapperIO and related classes
	* Fixed TurboR ST mapperIO

2001-10-01 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80 converted to a C++ class, still needs cleanups
	* IRQ handling cleanup

2001-09-30 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* second part of Z80 cleanup 

2001-09-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* #define -> static const int   cleanup
	* first part of Z80 cleanup

2001-09-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* reimplemented Scheduler, total new algorithm
	* made some changes to cpu-device's
	  these need some cleanup, especially the c/c++ mix (Z80)

2001-09-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* added locking to class EventDistributor (maybe std::multimap is
	  thread-safe and no locking is necessary)
	* added locking to class Mouse, there was a small race that could cause
	  some mouse-movement-glitches

2001-09-24 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented Real Time Clock device
	* implemented joystick support. Cannot be used yet since there is no
	  mechanism to plug a Joystick in a joystickPort yet (dynamically nor
	  statically)
	* implemented mouse support. Cannot be used yet, same reason as above

2001-09-23 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made sperate thread for event handler
	  other classes can ask EventDistributor to receive specific events
	* adapted Inputs for new event model
	* respond to SDL_QUIT event

2001-09-23 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	*  various small fixes
	* started working on making the code work with gcc-3.0
	* added autogen.sh: use to regenerate build files
	* added m4/ dir for own autoconf m4 macros
	* added fstream_templ.m4, since in gcc-3.0 ifstream
	  is templatized on type, and .read() returns char,
	  not unsigned char, soo this needs ifstream<byte> in
	  openmsx, but in gcc-2.95 ifstream is not a template.
	* added -fno-rtti to compile-flags since we don't use
	  runtime type inspection anyway, and it increases binary size
	  see also: http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2000-03/msg00064.html

2001-09-22 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* cleanups in most devices
	* small bug fixes in some devices
	* Implemented memory mapper
	  all mappers share one MapperIO device
	  reading from mapper ports can be customized

2001-09-21 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* Z80/R800 separation cleaned up:
	  only the class MSXCPU knows there are 2 CPU's, all other devices
	  should talk to MSXCPU instead of MSXZ80 or MSXR800 (nor ask
	  MSXMotherBoard which CPU to talk to)
	  Removed some code marked as "ugly hack"
	* added support for Kanji ROM
	* cleanups in MSXRom16KB 

2001-09-19 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* various small fixes around the code
	* the 16k rom still needs a C++ makeover

2001-09-17 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented kana/code led
	* implemented joystick-ports. This is only the port, not the devices
	  that can be plugged into the port (joystick, mouse, ...)
	* interupt handling was seriously broken (CPU jumped to 0x38 at every
	  di->ei transition even when there was no device that had raised an IRQ)
	  Fixed now (I think). Also moved interrupt related methods from class
	  Scheduler to class MSXMotherBoard.

2001-09-16 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* implemented sound generation for PSG (code taken from xmame-0.37b)
	  mixer is not finished, so you won't hear anything yet

2001-09-16 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added endian-ness check to configure.in
	* removed -DLDB_FIRST, and made it dependant on
	  configure result
	* added sizeof long autoconf check, to make Z80.cc
	  also work correctly on 64 bit and 128 bit cpu's [untested]

2001-09-15 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* started implemention of MSXPSG (no sound generation yet)

2001-09-15 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* reworked msxconfig.cc by using the xmlhelper
	* xmlhelper is a simplified xml interface

2001-09-13 Joost Yervante Damad <j.damad@qahwah.net>
	* added xmlhelper class, which I will start using
	  to make xmlconfig code cleaner
	* made msxconfig more standards-compliant

2001-09-10 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* removed double initialization
	* CPU is no longer a special case with initialization
	* fixed various bugs
	* made Inputs independent from MSXPPI
	* implemented CAPS LED + support for all other LEDs

2001-09-09 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* print more usefull debug messages
	* use DummyDevice instead of the general MSXDevice for all the
	  emptyDevice's
	* registering SP must be done by Scheduler, not Motherboard

2001-09-08 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* some fixes (yesterday discussed with Davy)

2001-09-05 David Heremans <david.heremans@gnu-linux.net>
	* sync : PPI, Z80, ...
	* Z80 should be completely correct now
	* started integrating SDL keys
	* VDP integration Sean's code started
	* subslot selecting and mainslot selecting imped
	* MSXMotherboard slotlayout filled with dummy
	  empty devices to avoid 0-pointers

2001-09-03 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* In class Scheduler, use "set" instead of "list" or "sortedlist"
	* Split MSXPPI in a MSX depended part and a reuseable 8255 part

2001-08-27 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* made a more complete PPI implementation
	* made new device: E6Timer (TurboR)

2001-08-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
	* removed linkedlist.hh and use stl list instead
	* made template SortedList and use it in Scheduler
	  this compiles, but does not link yet

2001-08-25 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@student.kuleuven.ac.be>
