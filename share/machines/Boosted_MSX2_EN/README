This directory contains a so-called "Boosted" MSX2 configuration. It has the
following features:

- based on Philips NMS-8250 (most standard MSX2 in the Netherlands at least)
- two external slots, slot B is a sub slot (2-1)
- 2048kB memory mapper (in slot 3-2)
- 2 disk drives
- V9958 VDP
- SCC+ in slot 2-0
- FMPAC (slot 3-1)
- MSX Audio
- Moonsound with 640kB sample RAM
- GFX9000 (note that it's still experimental)
- 512kB MegaRAM in slot 2-2

This configuration needs the following ROMs in the roms subdir:
- nms8250_disk.rom, nms8250_basic-bios2.rom, nms8250_msx2sub.rom: same as
  needed for the Philips NMS 8250 config
- fmpac.rom: same as needed for the FMPAC extension
- yrw801.rom: same as needed for the Moonsound extension

You can make this configuration the default by changing the 'machine' setting from the console. See the Setup Guide and User's Manual sections of the manual.
