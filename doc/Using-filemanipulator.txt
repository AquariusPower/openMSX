filemanipulator
---------------

This is probably the most exuberant console command available in openMSX.
It implements the basic stuff needed to handle files and subdirs on MSX media.
It also helps one creating new disk image files, both simple 360 kB and 720 kB
disks as well as IDE-HD images containing up to 30 partitions of each 32 MB.
Creating disk images and manipulating the files on them can be done without the
need of a running emulated MSX (set power off).

generic structure
-----------------

The general command structure is always of the form:

filemanipulator <command> <disk name> <command arguments> where

  'commands' is one of: usePartition, import, export, savedsk, format, create,
        useFile, dir, mkdir, chdir
        useFile.

  'disk name' is most likely: diska, diskb, IDEHD or imagefile. 
        imagefile is only available after a useFile command.
        diska, diskb or IDE-HD are the drives available to the running emulated
        MSX machine. This allows interaction with the currently used disk
        images.

  'command arguments' depend upon the command involved, see the detailed
        descriptions of the commands below.


Detailed explanation
--------------------

savedsk
-------
    structure:
        filemanipulator savedsk <disk name> <dskfilename>

    explanation:
        This simply reads all the sectors of the <disk name> and saves them
        again in the file specified by <dskfilename>.
        This is thus equivalent to copying a dsk file on your host OS.
        The added values are:
        * the possibility of saving a ramdsk (see diska ramdsk)
        * saving your current DirAsDisk image into a real dsk file
        * copying the currently used file in case your host-OS would give
          sharing violations while the file is being used by openMSX (win32)
        * saving a dsk file if you by accident already removed the directory
          entry while openMSX is still using an open file handle towards it.

import
------
    structure:
        filemanipulator import <disk name> <host directory>

    explanation:
        This will import the files and subdirectories in <host directory> into
        the disk inserted in <disk name>.
        The place were the files will be added in the MSX directory structure
        are influenced by the 'usePartition' and 'chdir' command.

export
------
    structure:
        filemanipulator export <disk name> <host directory>

    explanation:
        This will export the files and subdirectories from the disk inserted in
        <disk name> to the <host directory> on your host OS.
        The subdirectory that will be exported from the MSX-images is
        influenced by the 'usePartition' and 'chdir' command.

chdir
-----
    structure:
        filemanipulator chdir <disk name> <MSX directory>

    explication:
        This command will select the directory on the MSX disk image that will
        be used for the export and import commands.


mkdir
-----
    structure:
        filemanipulator mkdir <disk name> <MSX directory>

    explication:
        This command will create the directory on the MSX disk image.
        Al the needed parent directories will be created if they do not yet
	exist.

dir
---
    structure:
        filemanipulator dir <disk name>

    explication:
        This will show the directory content of the curring working directory.
        The output is formated in a 'files,l' like manner.


usePartition
------------
    structure:
        filemanipulator usePartition <disk name> <partition number>

    explanation:
        In case the <disk name> contains a MSX IDE compatible partition table,
        this command will select the partition to be used for the
        import/export/chdir commands.
        Using tab completion will show to currently selected partition for the
        <disk name> device.
        If no valid partition table is found this will be equivalent to using
        partition 0.

format
------
    structure:
        filemanipulator format <disk name>

    explanation:
        The currently selected partition from <disk name> will be cleanly
        formated with a MSX-DOS2 boot sector. 
        FAT and directory sectors will be correctly initialised.

useFile
-------
    structure:
        filemanipulator useFile <dskfilename>

    explanation:
        Instead of relying on the devices emulated when performing operations
        using filemanipulator you can use any dsk image available to you by
        using the useFile command. This will register an extra '<disk name>'
        named 'imagefile' that can be treated by filemanipulator even when the
        current emulated MSX is in its power off state or doesn't have any
        disk drives whatsoever.

create
------
    structure:
        filemanipulator create  <dskfilename> <size/option> <size/option>...

    explanation:
        You can create new dsk files using this command.
        This new disk will be formated using an MSX-DOS2 boot sector
        you can specify multiple sizes in which case an MSX IDE compatible
        partitioned image will be created, each partition will be formatted as
        required.
        You can specify the disk/partition sizes be using the following
        postfixes:
                - no postfix  ->  size in sectors
                - S or s      ->  size in sectors
                - B or b      ->  size in bytes
                - K or k      ->  size in kilobytes
                - M or m      ->  size in megabytes

        When the file is cerated a 'useFile' will automatically be called for
        this new dsk image.
