Release Notes for openMSX 0.3.3 (2003-09-26)
============================================

This new release brings you the following improvements:
- Windows specific code was merged into the main branch. We have an
  "official" Win32 port that is part of this release.
- New HTML manuals replace the HOWTO. These manuals will make it easier for
  you to find the information you need. Also, the HTML layout looks better.
  Due to time pressure, the manuals are a bit rough at places, we'll improve
  them in the future.
- New MSX devices:
  * MSX-MIDI interface (turbo R).
  * MSX-RS-232 support (8255 UART).
  * PCM input (sampling) for turbo R via a .wav file.
- Added a debug device: write data to special I/O ports and its get logged
  to stdout or a file in a format you specify. Very useful if you develop
  MSX assembly programs in openMSX.
- Several improvements and fixes in the VDPCmdEngine; VDP emulation is even
  more accurate now.
- All read-only input files (ROM images, disk images, background pictures,
  XML) can now be gzipped or zipped and will be transparently decompressed
  by openMSX. Note that some games require write access to their disk in
  order to run (for example, Seed of Dragon).
- New dir-as-disk feature: a directory can be specified instead of a disk
  image and the contents (up to 720K) will show up as files on the MSX.
  There is no support for subdirectories (as used by DOS2) yet. This feature
  is still experimental, so please report problems if you encounter them.
- Several cassette emulation updates and new features:
  * Automatic .cas to .wav conversion in CassettePlayer.
    (no patched ROM needed anymore to run .cas files)
  * Cassette sounds are now audible.
  * Tapes can be rewinded.
  * Tapes can be forced to play.
    (like unplugging the 'remote control' plug on a real machine)
- A different keymap (e.g. for Japanese PC keyboards or to use Russian MSX
  keyboards on a US English PC keyboard) can be used now, via settings.xml.
- Keys for the key joystick are now configurable in settings.xml.
- Added joystick emulation for mouse (a feature that the Philips SBC-3810
  and Sony MOS-1 and similar mice have).
- Various console updates:
  * Tab completion behaves much more like the UNIX Bash shell now.
  * Clearer error messages.
  * More than one command is possible, use ';' to separate them.
    Especially useful for binding several commands to a single keypress.
- User-configurable channel settings for mono sound devices. You can set
  them to left, right or mono mode at run time.
- Many things are now user configurable via the console:
  * .wav input file for PCM sampler
  * log file for the printer logger
  * output file for the MIDI out logger
  * input file for the MIDI in reader
  * input and output file for the RS232-tester
- ROM database now uses SHA1 sums in stead of MD5 sums.
- The MSX turbo R machine description uses a single 4MB ROM image, plus the
  Kanji ROM. This is closer to how the real machine works.
- Several machine and extension configurations added.
- Fixed compilation on GCC 3.4-pre development version.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to
learn more about the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- In its current alpha state, openMSX is usable for power users, but its
  interface is not very friendly to casual users yet.
- Emulation is not perfect yet. However, in the emulator comparison of
  msx.org, openMSX scored highest on accuracy of all emulators tested
  and that was version 0.2.1.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible
  way without backwards compatibility. Keep this in mind if you create
  machine descriptions, ROM database entries etc.
- This openMSX release was tested on Linux and Win32.
  Running on BSD, Mac OS X, BeOS etc (wherever SDL runs) should be possible,
  but will probably not work out-of-the-box. If you are compiling on such a
  platform, please share your experiences (see below for contact info),
  so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX
  settings and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating.
  Some things run fine on a 200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz
  machine. For performance tuning tips, see the Setup Guide.
