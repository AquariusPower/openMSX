Release Notes for openMSX 0.8.2 (2012-xx-xx)
============================================

This is mostly a bug fix release with some small improvements.

Here's the list with all highlights:

New or improved emulator features:
- Debugging: added vdpcmdinprogress_callback setting, which can be used to
  trigger a script when a write to the VDP command engine registers is detected
  while there is still a VDP command in progress.
- Updated all scripts to make full use of Tcl 8.5 (and clean them up in the
  process)
- Fixed record_channels command to record to the soundlogs directory
- Added option to record all channels of all sound chips with record_channels
- Support in the hardware config XML format for using a single ROM image (i.e.
  a physical (EP)ROM dump) which is used by several devices
- Added new sound driver based on libao
- Laserdisc now also works on the SDL renderer
- Added horizontal stretch for SDL renderer (useful for Dingoo for instance)
- OSD menu improvements (mostly useful for hand held users):
  - added connector submenu
  - added support for running tapes
  - added support for horizontal stretch setting
- Added command line option -replay to load and view a replay and also support
  dropping replays (OMR files) on openMSX to view them
- Added command line option -savestate to load a savestate and also support
  dropping savestates (OMS files) on openMSX to view them
- Added recognition of .tcl extension as extra start up scripts
- Make PgUp/PgDn reverse step depend on the speed setting
- Fix Caps lock behaviour on Mac OS X
- Added new fantasy machine: Boosted MSX2+ JP, based on Panasonic FS-A1WSX
- Added basic compiler to Boosted MSX2 EN
- Allow joystick axis motion events to be bound, as the manual promises
- Made real joystick support a bit more flexible
- Add support for MIDI output to a virtual endpoint for Mac OS X
- Fixed recognition of OMR/OMS files which were re-gzipped
- Fixed sound quality of blip resampler
- About command now also shows settings
- Fixed memory usage issue when using step_back (e.g. via debugger)
- Greatly improved performance for step_back
- Sync sound to EmuTime (greatly improves sample playback in e.g. Real Motion
  and TRAX Player
- Fixed crash in YM2151 (in Yamaha CX5M)
- Fixed sample playing in Nettou Yakyuu
- Fixed 64k ROM mapper detection

MSX device support:
- Accuracy improvements:
  - MSX-MUSIC (YM2413 (Okazaki)): implemented SETTLE (or DUMP) phase
  - MSX-AUDIO (Y8950): BUF_RDY status bit (for sound quality when playing
    samples)
  - MoonSound (YMF278): fixed x-tal frequency and some other details
- Added support for several laserdisc features to be able to run the Lascommate
  Junior High School Mathematics LD's, including a dummy Lascom Kanji cartridge
  implementation
- Fixed bug (regression in 0.8.1) with sprite colors (visible in Ikari for
  instance)
- Fixed regression bug in drum sounds of Okazaki YM2413 emulation
- Fixed bug in VDP emulation, which was visible in Psycho World's 3x3 power up
  matrix
- Fixed bug in Y8950 (MSX-AUDIO) when using NOP Real Motion
- Fixed Gradiente Expert DDPlus FDC configuration
- Fixed bug in MoonSound FM 4op mode
- Added emulation of the following mapper types:
  - Baby Dinosaur Dooly
  - Manbow 2 2nd release
  - Best of Hamaraja Night
- Added emulation of memory based I/O for MSX RS-232C, making emulation of Sony
  HBI-232 possible
- Added Sony HB-F9S and Sony HB-G900P machine

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- Upgraded Tcl dependency to Tcl 8.5
- Upgraded 3rd party libs
- Optional additional dependency on libao
- Added support for the Clang compiler
- Make our ARM inline asm routines compile in Thumb2 mode
- Moved Dingux port to OpenDingux: openMSX now only compiles for OpenDingux
- Added lto flavour to enable Link-Time Optimization

And of course the usual various bug fixes.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- Emulation is not perfect yet.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible way
  without backwards compatibility. This happened between 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, for
  example. Keep this in mind if you create machine descriptions, ROM database
  entries etc. We do try to be backwards compatible for at least one release,
  though. Keep in mind that openMSX is still evolving at a considerable speed.
- openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux,
  Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM,
  MIPS and Sparc CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs)
  or CPU's should be possible, but may require some modifications to the build
  system. If you are compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences
  (see below for contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
  and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
  200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
  tips, see the Setup Guide.
