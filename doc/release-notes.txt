Release Notes for openMSX 0.3.2 (2003-06-09)
============================================

This new release brings you the following improvements:
- New feature: MoonSound support.
  Original implementation taken from MAME, thanks to Jarek Burczynski
  (FM code), R. Belmont and O. Galibert (wave code) for allowing us
  to use their code in openMSX.
  Improvements and bug fixes were done by Arjan Bakker and our team.
- New MSX devices:
  * MegaRAM
  * PAC (Panasonic SW-M001)
  * Support for 8kB ROMs
- New feature: grab input (try "set grabinput on").
  When enabled, the native mouse cursor cannot escape from the openMSX
  window anymore; makes using the mouse a lot easier in windowed mode.
- New timer using the Linux Real Time Clock (RTC), which is more accurate
  than the SDL timer. SDL timer is still available as a fallback.
  Instructions to configure your system for using the RTC are in the HOWTO.
- New effect in the SDLGL renderer: afterglow (try "set glow N").
- User-configurable gamma correction (try "set gamma X").
  Also the default value is less bright than the previous hard-coded value.
- Screen accuracy works now (try "set accuracy screen").
  It is fast, but very inaccurate.
- Volume of sound devices can be adjusted at run time.
- Various console updates:
  * Commands can be on multiple lines.
  * Search in command history.
  * Command history is saved.
  * Support in SDLHi/Lo for console font PNG images in indexed mode.
    Previously, only images in RGB mode were supported.
  * Console remains usable when openMSX is paused.
- Several machine configurations added (thanks to Albert Beevendorp).
- Several extension configurations added.
- Cache coherency problem in SDLGL renderer fixed.
  This bug caused garbled graphics in for example Ark-a-Noah and Dr Archie.
- Fixed compilation on GCC 2.95.

Read the "ChangeLog" inside the archive for a detailed list of changes.
In "doc/openMSX-HOWTO.txt" you can find a lot of useful information on
openMSX, make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but
also to learn more about how to deal with the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- In its current alpha state, openMSX is usable for power users, but its
  interface is not very friendly to casual users yet.
- Emulation is not perfect yet. However, in the emulator comparison of
  msx.org, openMSX scored highest on accuracy of all emulators tested.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible
  way without backwards compatibility. Keep this in mind if you create
  machine descriptions, ROM database entries etc.
- This openMSX release is only tested on Linux.
  Reikan maintains a Win32 port, which follows openMSX CVS closely, but is
  not yet built from the exact same code base. You can find its binaries and
  source patches at http://www.ranpub.com/openMSX4Win32/
  Running on BSD, Mac OS X, BeOS etc (wherever SDL runs) should be possible,
  but will probably not work out-of-the-box. If you are compiling on such a
  platform, please share your experiences (see below for contact info),
  so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX
  settings and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating.
  Some things run fine on a 200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz
  machine. Some performance tips:
  * Make sure there are no CPU consuming background processes running.
  * Generally, MSX1 emulation is fastest and turbo R emulation is slowest.
  * SDLGL renderer needs hardware acceleration to run at a decent speed.
    Disabling scanlines and blur (set to 0) helps on older graphics cards.
  * Use 16-bit colour mode instead of 32-bit (platform setting is used).
  * Use line accuracy (default) instead of pixel accuracy.
  * Turn on frame skip ("set frameskip auto").
  * Use low-res SDLLo renderer (75% less pixels to fill).
