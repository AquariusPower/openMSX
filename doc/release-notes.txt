Release Notes for openMSX 0.3.3 (2003-09-24)
============================================

This new release brings you the following improvements:
- Windows specific code is now in the main branch
- Several cassette emulation updates and new features:
  * Automatic .cas to .wav conversion in CassettePlayer (no patched ROM
    needed anymore to run .cas files!)
  * cassette sounds are now audible
  * tapes can be rewinded
  * tapes can be forced to play (like unplugging the 'remote control'
    plug on a real machine)
- ROM database now uses SHA1 sums in stead of MD5 sums
- New MSX devices:
  * MSX-MIDI in turboR; you can redirect MIDI to /dev/midi and get sound
    that way!
  * MSX-RS-232 support (8255 UART)
  * PCM input (sampling) for TurboR via a .wav file
- User-configurable channel settings for mono sound devices. You can set
  them to left, right or mono mode at run time.
- Many things are now user configurable via the console:
  * .wav input file for PCM sampler
  * log file for the printer logger
  * output file for the MIDI out logger
  * input file for the MIDI in reader
  * input and output file for the RS232-tester
- Keys for the key joystick are now configurable in settings.xml
- A different keymap (e.g. for Japanese PC keyboards or to use Russian
  MSX keyboards on a US English PC keyboard) can be used now, via
  settings.xml
- All read only input files (ROM images, disk images, background
  pictures, XML) can now be gzipped or zipped
- Various console updates:
  * Console behaves much more like the UNIX Bash shell now
  * Better more UNIX style error messages
  * More than one command is possible, use ';' to separate them
- Added joystick emulation for mouse (a feature that the Philips
  SBC-3810 and Sony MOS-1 and similar mice have)
- Added a debug device: write data to special I/O ports and they get in
  stdout or a file
- The MSXturboR machine config only needs the 4MB ROM and the kanji ROM now.
- Several improvements and fixes in the VDPCmdEngine; VDP emulation is
  even more accurate now
- Several machine configurations added.
- Several extension configurations added.

Read the "ChangeLog" inside the archive for a detailed list of changes.
In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a lot of useful information on
openMSX, make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but
also to learn more about how to deal with the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- In its current alpha state, openMSX is usable for power users, but its
  interface is not very friendly to casual users yet.
- Emulation is not perfect yet. However, in the emulator comparison of
  msx.org, openMSX scored highest on accuracy of all emulators tested
  and that was version 0.2.1.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible
  way without backwards compatibility. Keep this in mind if you create
  machine descriptions, ROM database entries etc.
- This openMSX release was tested on Linux and Win32.
  Running on BSD, Mac OS X, BeOS etc (wherever SDL runs) should be possible,
  but will probably not work out-of-the-box. If you are compiling on such a
  platform, please share your experiences (see below for contact info),
  so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX
  settings and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating.
  Some things run fine on a 200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz
  machine. Some performance tips:
  * Make sure there are no CPU consuming background processes running.
  * Generally, MSX1 emulation is fastest and turbo R emulation is slowest.
  * SDLGL renderer needs hardware acceleration to run at a decent speed.
    Disabling scanlines and blur (set to 0) helps on older graphics cards.
  * Use 16-bit colour mode instead of 32-bit (platform setting is used).
  * Use line accuracy (default) instead of pixel accuracy.
  * Turn on frame skip ("set frameskip auto").
  * Use low-res SDLLo renderer (75% less pixels to fill).
