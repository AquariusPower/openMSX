Release Notes for openMSX 0.5.0 (2004-10-??)
============================================

This new release brings you the following improvements:
- Complete redesign of the hardware configuration files, including a lot of
  renames and I/O ports being specified in them.
- Added ROM pools: the new XML hardware configuration file specifies the sha1
  sum of the necessary ROMs, which will be automatically searched from ROM
  pools; directories where the user can put all system ROMs. Default:
  share/systemroms
- (Almost) all settings (including key bindings and user directories) can be
  saved to a config file now. No need to edit settings.xml anymore. Defaults are
  hardcoded now
- Implemented MMX and MMXext optimisations, which can mean quite a speedup
- Added channel mode 'off' to mute individual sound devices
- Added a debugger interface to all (S)RAM
- Moonsound fixes
- Internal clock refactoring, thanks to Daniel Vik for finding the problem
- Added simple DC filter for cassette images. .wav files from MicroWAVer should
  work now
- Added slotexpander extension: use it to change one primary slot into four
  secondary slots!
- Added meta data of machines in config files, which is (partly) shown in the
  window title bar
- Improvements in the 'type' command, thanks to Albert Beevendorp (and Arnold
  Metselaar, welcome to the club!)
- Graphical system now uses layers
- Basic build support for AMD64
- 8kB BASIC ROMs now work correctly and are auto detected
- Scale2x and hq2x now also work in hi-res modes (screen 6 and 7)
- Added new settings, partly to replace stuff from the old settings.xml:
  * frequency: the sound mixer frequency (needs openMSX restart)
  * machine: the default machine (needs openMSX restart of course)
  * samples: the size of the sound mixing buffer (needs openMSX restart)
  * save_settings_on_exit: auto save settings when openMSX quits
  * user_directories: to specify directories that have to be searched in
- New commands:
  * iomap: list the I/O ports and the devices connected to them
  * save_settings: save current settings to file
- Added emulation of the dongle of Tetris II Special Edition
- Added blur effect for the SDLHi renderer
- Added format command for TC8566AF FDC, thanks to Daniel Vik
- Added openMSX FAQ to documentation
- Release key presses when the console becomes active
- Improved geometry detection of disk images (MSX1Mania disks work now)
- Force PSG portA to be input port
- Big speed up of scanline effect
- Made pixel accuracy the default
- Removed faulty 8bpp support
- Improvements on new build system: separate OS and CPU
- Loads and loads of (other) bug fixes

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to
learn more about the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- Emulation is not perfect yet. However, in the emulator comparison of
  msx.org, openMSX scored highest on accuracy of all emulators tested
  and that was version 0.2.1.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible
  way without backwards compatibility. Keep this in mind if you create
  machine descriptions, ROM database entries etc. This happened severely when
  going from version 0.4.0 to 0.5.0, for example.
- This release was tested on Linux, Win32, Mac OS X and FreeBSD 4 and 5.
  TODO: really test on Mac OS X and FreeBSD 5!
  Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) should be possible,
  but will probably not work out-of-the-box. If you are compiling on such a
  platform, please share your experiences (see below for contact info),
  so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX
  settings and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating.
  Some things run fine on a 200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz
  machine. For performance tuning tips, see the Setup Guide.
