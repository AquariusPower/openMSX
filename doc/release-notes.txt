Release Notes for openMSX 0.6.2 (2007-04-??)
============================================

The most interesting change for users in this release is the addition of the
video recorder. It enables you to record (very accurate) videos, including
sound, of what you are doing with your emulated MSX. Thanks to the DosBox Team
for their great ZMBV lossless video codec.

Then, there are quite some internal changes and bug fixes. We also made better
use of our new advanced SDLGL-PP renderer; it can do almost the same as the SDL
renderer now (and more). We have also done our best to do various considerable
speed optimizations for this release. The SDLGL-PP renderer can be up to 50%
faster and also the SDL renderer is about 6% faster. So, if you had problems
with speed, you might want to give this release a try.

The trainers that are shipped with openMSX are now a lot more user friendly. It
is possible to enable or disable individual cheats of a trained game.

New or improved emulator features:
- Video recording and improved sound recording (stutterless).
- SDLGL-PP renderer (OpenGL-2.0), now adds hq and hqlite in hardware and
  various speed optimizations.
- More usable trainers
- Extended hotkeys: you can now bind any host event to a TCL command, which
  means you can e.g. let openMSX push the MSX F1 key if you press a certain
  button on your PC game pad.
- Event recording and replaying (experimental for now: only available at
  command line, so per session).
- Debugger now supports watchpoint regions.

MSX device support:
- Dot matrix graphical printer emulation added (thanks to the blueMSX Team).
- V9990 enhancements: deinterlace, cursor Y position in overscan mode, huge
  speed optimizations for P modes.
- SCC sound quality improvements (no more aliasing).
- Small bugfixes in various devices: MSX-Audio, V9990, VDP, SCC, PSG, TC8566AF.
- Support for the Playball mapper (and samples).
- Cassetteplayer recognizes end of tape and stops.
- Various speed optimizations: VDP command engine, Z80, video rendering, V9990,
  debugger response time in break mode.
- Fixed mirroring of some FDC registers and diskROMs.
- Added a few Arabic MSX machines, but note that they have not been verified
  to be correct.

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- It is now possible to build a universal binary for MacOS X.
- It is possible to build an app for MacOS X.
- HTMLized the Console Command Reference and the diskmanipulator documentation.
  There is now also linking to these new manuals, which improved the usefulness
  of them a lot.
- Added a text document about how developers can control openMSX from their own
  application: doc/openmsx-control-xml.txt.

And of course the usual various bug fixes.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- Emulation is not perfect yet.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible way
  without backwards compatibility. This happened between 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, for
  example. Keep this in mind if you create machine descriptions, ROM database
  entries etc. We do try to be backwards compatible for at least one release,
  though. Keep in mind that openMSX is still evolving at a considerable speed.
- openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Win32,
  Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, Sparc and PPC CPU's.
  Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should be
  possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
  compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
  contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
  and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
  200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz machine. For performance tuning
  tips, see the Setup Guide.
