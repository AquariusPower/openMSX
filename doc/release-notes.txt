Release notes for openMSX 0.3.1 (2003-05-18)
============================================

It's been a short time since 0.3.0, but we thought the following changes are
important enough to release now:
- Fixed compilation on GCC 3.3.
- Fixed SDLGL renderer on XFree86 4.3.

Regular development continued as well, so this release also contains
the following improvements:
- New feature: configurable file-extentions.
- Improved layout of help text (try "openmsx -h").
- Many improvements to the console, including:
  * Extended the console editing keys (left, right, del, bs, home, end etc).
  * Added key repeat.
  * Reset the scrollback when any key other than page up/down is used.
  * Added resizing and moving to the console.
  * SDL console characters are no longer blended (improved readability).
  * SDL backgroundimage can be scaled and can have any pixel format.
  * Fixed colour of font on GLConsole overlayed on Text1 mode.
- Emulation and event handling are now done in a single thread.
  The previous multi-threaded solution was not very portable among platforms
  or even different versions of the same platform.
  As a bonus, the single thread model is simpler and more efficient.
- Improved "make install".
- Cleanups of the directory structure.

Read the "ChangeLog" inside the archive for a detailed list of changes.
In "doc/openMSX-HOWTO.txt" you can find a lot of useful information on
openMSX, make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before.

Known issues / caveats:
- In its current alpha state, openMSX is usable for power users, but its
  interface is not very friendly to casual users yet.
- Emulation is not perfect yet. However, in the emulator comparison of
  msx.org, openMSX scored highest on accuracy of all emulators tested.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible
  way without backwards compatiblity. Keep this in mind if you create
  machine descriptions, rom database entries etc.
- This openMSX release is only tested on Linux.
  Reikan maintains a Win32 port, which follows openMSX CVS closely, but is
  not the same. You can find it at http://www.ranpub.com/openMSX4Win32/
  Running on BSD, Mac OS X, BeOS etc (wherever SDL runs) should be possible,
  but will probably not work out-of-the-box. If you are compiling on such a
  platform, please share your experiences (see below for contact info),
  so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX
  settings and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating.
  Some things run fine on a 200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz
  machine. Some performance tips:
  * Make sure there are no CPU consuming background processes running.
  * Generally, MSX1 emulation is fastest and turbo R emulation is slowest.
  * SDLGL renderer needs hardware acceleration to run at a decent speed.
    Disabling scanlines and blur (set to 0) helps on older graphics cards.
  * Use 16-bit colour mode instead of 32-bit (platform setting is used).
  * Use line accuracy (default) instead of pixel accuracy.
  * Turn on frame skip ("set frameskip auto").
  * Use low-res SDLLo renderer (75% less pixels to fill).
