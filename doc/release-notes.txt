Release Notes for openMSX 0.5.1 (2005-03-xx)
============================================

This release includes a complete redesign of the ROM database XML file. The
file will be extended to a generic software database dump, with a central MySQL
database as source. This database will be shared between the blueMSX and
openMSX project. Other emulator authors are welcome to participate as well, of
course.

Another new thing is that this release is the first which supports Sunrise
GFX9000 to a usable extent. We have been working on this for quite some time
already, but in this release you can see the first usable results. Do note that
the emulation is still far from complete, fast or bug free. But we thought you
might appreciate it already in its current shape.

Other big noticable changes are firstly the addition of the OSD LEDs. This way
you can see what's going on with the LEDs in full screen and without Catapult
as well. Secondly, the sound quality has improved a lot for certain devices,
including PCM, because of a new mixer implementation. Lastly, there is now
support for IPS patches: patch disk and ROM images without modifying the image
file!

New or improved emulator features:
- Debugging: enabled 'cputrace' setting for normal builds as well.
- Various speed ups, especially for low end machines due to better frame skip.
- 'samples' and 'frequency' setting can now be switched at run time.
- OSD LEDs are configurable via TCL scripts.
- Extensions inside ZIP files are now used to guess the right file type.
- New 'escape_grab' command: escapes from 'grabinput' once.
- You can now use IPS patches to modify disk and ROM images without changing the
  images.
- New ROM database, shared with blueMSX.

MSX device support:
- Added usable GFX9000 support; use the 'videosource' setting to switch.
- Drastical improvement of sound quality due to new mixer implementation.
- Fixes in Tetris II Special Edition dongle.
- Timing improvements of the WD2793 FDC. Fixes a few games that rely on it.
- The 13 bit MSX-AUDIO DAC actually works now (used in modplayer).
- Fixed booting of SVI-738 CP/M disks.
- Fixed turboR DRAM support. Programs that use this, like TRCAS, work now.
- Added MegaRAM Disk, thanks to Adriano da Cunha.
- Improved Sony HBI-55, thanks to Daniel Vik.
- Added MSX-AUDIO 2 extension. This is an Y8910 on alternative I/O ports.
- Added separate machine configuration for Philips VG 8020/20.

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- We now provide Debian packages, shortly after release, as well.
- Build support for OpenBSD and NetBSD.
- Many fixes for Mac OS X.
- Updated C-BIOS to 0.20.

And of course the usual various bug fixes.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

Known issues / caveats:
- Emulation is not perfect yet.
  See the bug tracker on sourceforge.net for known bugs.
- Until we reach version 1.0.0, file formats can change in an incompatible way
  without backwards compatibility. This happened between 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, for
  example. Keep this in mind if you create machine descriptions, ROM database
  entries etc.
- openMSX is confirmed to run on Linux, Win32, Mac OS X, OpenBSD, NetBSD and 
  FreeBSD 4 and 5, on x86, x86-64 and PPC.
  Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPUs should be
  possible, but will require some modifications to the build system. If you are
  compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
  contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
- CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
  and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
  200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz machine. For performance tuning
  tips, see the Setup Guide.
