Release Notes for openMSX 0.10.0 (2013-10-??)
=============================================

This release adds many larger and smaller features, but most outstanding are:
cycle accurate VDP command engine timing, an Android port, subdirectory support
for dir-as-disk and Neos MA-20 support. These features meant a lot of work was
done in practically all parts of the code (of which you can read the results in
the complete list below), but at the same time we also freshened up much of the
code using many of the new C++11 language features. All in all, it was time to
release this stuff officially...

Here's the list with all highlights:

MSX device support:
- accuracy improvements:
  - improved TMS99X8/TMS9929 color palette
  - improved V9990/GFX9000:
    - VRAM reads go via 1-byte buffer
    - VRAM read/write pointers only get updated when R#2 and R#5 get written
    - fixed initial content of VRAM of GFX9000
    - V9990 P1/P2 sprites that are disabled still count for the 16 sprite limit
    - fixed roll behaviour of layer B in P1 mode
  - turboR TC8566AF has other register memory mapping than other machines
  - use correct Kanji font ROM for Victor HC-95A and removed S1985
  - added cycle accurate VDP command engine timing
  - fixes in YM2413 emulation (FMPAC)
- added mapper support:
  - MSXtra cartridge (a debugging tool released by PTC which has its own RAM)
  - MultiROM Collection, designed by Manuel Pazos in 2006
  - ASCII8 mapper with 2kB SRAM
  - ASCII16 mapper with 8kB SRAM
  - Super Swangi (a.k.a. Super Altered Beast)
- added support for MSX touch pad
- added mu-PACK extension, a MIDI module to upgrade a turboR ST to GT
- added support for large hard disk images and LaserDisc images (>4GB)
- added initial RAM patterns for Sony HB-F1XDJ and Sanyo PHC-23J
- added support for Neos MA-20 Version Up Adapter (MSX1 to MSX2 converter),
  insert both Neos_MA-20R and Neos_MA-20V extensions for this
- fixed Toshiba MSX-AUDIO with no sample RAM
- fixes in joystick, mouse and track ball emulation
- minor fixes in Y8950 (MSX-AUDIO) and YMF262 (MoonSound)
- added OPL3Cartridge2_mono and OPL3Cartridge2_stereo extensions
- added Yamaha SFG-01 extension and replaced the SFG-05 with the SFG-01 in the
  CX5M machine
- added Casio PV-16, Casio P-7, Casio MX-10, Goldstar FC-80U and Sony HB-F1XV
  machines and an experimental Zemmix Super V (Daewoo CPC-61) machine config

New or improved emulator features:
- added subdirectory support for dir-as-disk
- added configurable host to MSX joystick mapping, e.g. useful to bind the
  crawl command (button A+B) in Metal Gear 2 to a single PC joystick button
- added support for bash completion (useful for using openMSX on the bash
  command line)
- performance improvements:
  - improved start-up performance (on Dingoo openMSX starts over 20% faster)
  - reduced CPU overhead when enabling reverse
  - further optimized CPU emulation
  - sped up CAS loading (use 3744 baud instead of 2760 baud)
  - reduce input latency (poll host events more often and remove delays)
  - speed up reverse in combination with harddisk by using incremental hashing
- reverse/TAS:
  - added reverse subcommand to truncate the current replay
  - show 2 decimals in the reverse bar time
  - added bookmarks feature to reverse bar
  - added possibility to customize TAS key bindings in an external script
  - added setting to auto save replays at intervals
  - added command to reset the lag counter
  - added commands to go to frame boundaries and advance/reverse to frame
    boundaries
  - show values of TAS widgets also in the middle of a frame
- several improvements on the OSD menu:
  - several improvements on the file browser
  - better error handling
  - only show media menu options that are relevant for the current machine
    (e.g. do not show disk drives when the machine has none)
  - added support for LaserDisc
  - added a quit menu with confirmation
  - added limitsprites setting
  - added basic mouse/touch support
  - only show video options if they actually make sense
- remove SSE and MMX assembly routines, only keep rewritten SSE2 routines
- added interleaving with black frame for monitors with LightBoost support
- added OSD widget that displays how busy the VDP is

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- created Android port (available via Google Play)
- migrated to git
- updated Windows build to Visual Studio 2012 update 3
- now a compiler which supports C++11 is required to compile openMSX, like g++
  4.6, clang 3.0 or Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
- integrated Dingoo packaging in the build system
- better support for 64 bit systems (sizes, memory, etc.)
- added document about details on VDP command engine timing
- changed machine configurations from specific directories to just an XML file
- removed the GP2X port

And of course the usual various bug fixes.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
