diskmanipulator
---------------

This is probably the most exuberant console command available in openMSX.
It implements the basic stuff needed to handle files and subdirs on MSX media.
It also helps one creating new disk image files, both simple 360 kB and 720 kB
disks as well as IDE-HD images containing up to 30 partitions of each 32 MB.
Creating disk images and manipulating the files on them can be done without the
need of a running emulated MSX (set power off).

generic structure
-----------------

The general command structure is always of the form:

diskmanipulator <command> <disk name> <command arguments> where

  'commands' is one of: import, export, savedsk, format, create,
        dir, mkdir, chdir

  'disk name' is most likely: diska, diskb, hda or the special virtual_drive
        device. diska, diskb or hda are the drives available to the running
        emulated MSX machine. This allows interaction with the currently used
        disk images.
        In case the disk contains an MSX-IDE compatible partitiontable you can
        add a partitionnumber, from 1 till 31, to the disk name to determine on
        which partition the command needs to act (eg. hda2, hdb3).

  'command arguments' depend upon the command involved, see the detailed
        descriptions of the commands below.


Detailed explanation
--------------------

savedsk
-------
    structure:
        diskmanipulator savedsk <disk name> <dskfilename>

    explanation:
        This simply reads all the sectors of the <disk name> and saves them
        again in the file specified by <dskfilename>.
        This is thus equivalent to copying a dsk file on your host OS.
        The added values are:
        * the possibility of saving a ramdsk (see diska -ramdsk)
        * saving your current DirAsDisk image into a real dsk file
        * copying the currently used imagefile in case your host-OS would give
          sharing violations while the file is being used by openMSX (win32)
        * saving a dsk file if you by accident already removed the directory
          entry while openMSX is still using an open file handle towards it.

import
------
    structure:
        diskmanipulator import <disk name> <host directory|host file>...

    explanation:
        This will import the single <host file> into the disk inserted in
        <disk name>.  In case of a <host directory> it  will import the
        files and subdirectories in <host directory> into the inserted disk.
        Multiple files and directories can be specified at the same time.
        The place were the files will be added in the MSX directory structure
        are influenced by the 'chdir' command.

        If you want to use wildcards when importing files you will have to use
        the TCL glob-command. This command will perform the wildcard expantion
        and return a TCL list. Enclose the glob command inbetween '[' and ']'

           diskmanipulator import hda1 [glob *.txt] [glob *.asc]

        The glob-command can also take extra options. For instance, if you only
        want to expand regular files and not the names of directories you can
        do this:

           diskmanipulator import hda1 [glob -type f info*] 

        Consult you local TCL guru or documentation for more info about the
        glob-command and TCL lists.


export
------
    structure:
        diskmanipulator export <disk name> <host directory>

    explanation:
        This will export the files and subdirectories from the disk inserted in
        <disk name> to the <host directory> on your host OS.
        The subdirectory that will be exported from the MSX-images is
        influenced by the 'chdir' command.

chdir
-----
    structure:
        diskmanipulator chdir <disk name> <MSX directory>

    explanation:
        This command will select the directory on the MSX disk image that will
        be used for the export and import commands.


mkdir
-----
    structure:
        diskmanipulator mkdir <disk name> <MSX directory>

    explanation:
        This command will create the directory on the MSX disk image.
        Al the needed parent directories will be created if they do not yet
        exist.

dir
---
    structure:
        diskmanipulator dir <disk name>

    explanation:
        This will show the directory content of the curring working directory.
        The output is formated in a 'files,l' like manner.

format
------
    structure:
        diskmanipulator format <disk name>

    explanation:
        The currently selected partition from <disk name> will be cleanly
        formated with a MSX-DOS2 boot sector. 
        FAT and directory sectors will be correctly initialised.

create
------
    structure:
        diskmanipulator create  <dskfilename> <size/option> <size/option>...

    explanation:
        You can create new dsk files using this command.
        This new disk will be formated using an MSX-DOS2 boot sector
        you can specify multiple sizes in which case an MSX IDE compatible
        partitioned image will be created, each partition will be formatted as
        required.
        You can specify the disk/partition sizes be using the following
        postfixes:
                - S or s      ->  size in sectors
                - B or b      ->  size in bytes
                - K or k      ->  size in kilobytes (default)
                - M or m      ->  size in megabytes
