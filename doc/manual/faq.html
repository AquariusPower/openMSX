<h2><a id="difficult">1. Why is openMSX so difficult to use/install?</a></h2>

<h2><a id="roms">2. Why doesn't openMSX come with system ROMs?</a> </h2>

<p>
The MSX system ROMs are copyrighted. In other words: it's illegal to include them in our software package without a license. See also the <a class="external" href="setup.html#systemroms">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="whereroms">3. Where do I install the ROMs?</a> </h2>

<p>0.5.0: ROMpool, older version: share/machines/WHATEVER/roms and share/extensions/WHATEVER/roms TODO: format this nicely.
See also the <a class="external" href="setup.html#dumprom">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="c-bios">4. All I get is "Cartridge not found." What's wrong?</a></h2>

<p>You are probably talking about this:</p>

<p class="image">
<img src="cartnotfound.png" width="320" height="240" alt="Cartridge not found."></img>
</p>

<p>openMSX doesn't come with any system ROMs, see <a class="internal" href="#roms">2. Why doesn't openMSX come with system ROMs?</a>. To have something to be able to run some software, openMSX comes with a free replacement of an MSX BIOS ROM called C-BIOS, written by BouKiChi and Reikan. This is also what you can see in the screen: C-BIOS 0.17. 
</p>

<p>
So, the message is not from openMSX, but from C-BIOS, which tries to start a cartridge that is inserted in the MSX that is being emulated by openMSX. And it seems you didn't insert any cartridge for it... So, either run openMSX with a ROM image or install real MSX system ROMs for a certain machine and run that one.
</p>

<p>Note that the current version of C-BIOS can only run cartridges and does not support disk or tape usage. More information can be found in the <a class="external" href="setup.html#cbios">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="samples040">5. The sound quality is quite bad in the 0.4.0 release, is that normal?</a></h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we made a small mistake in the Windows release of 0.4.0. However, the problem can be easily fixed by editing the file share\settings.xml with Notepad or some similar text editor. Look for the section marked "Audio mixer settings" and change the 'samples' setting from 512 to 1024 or 2048. You can play around with the setting: just save the file and restart openMSX to test it.
