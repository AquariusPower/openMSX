<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1 New Versions of this Document</a></h3>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/manual/">http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use this URL to get up-to-date versions of the hyperlinks
if you printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2 Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This guide is about openMSX, the open source MSX emulator that tries to achieve
near-perfect emulation by using a novel emulation model.
You can find more information about openMSX on the
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/">openMSX home page</a>.
You can also download the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all
features are implemented yet.
Many emulation features are implemented, but in terms of user interface
it is rather bare bones, unless you use the optional Graphical User Interface dubbed openMSX Catapult.
However, because the emulation is already pretty good,
it would be nice if non-insiders would be able to play with it, too.
For those people, we have written this guide.
It explains how you can get the emulator running on your system,
i.e. how to get the sources and compile them. Note that some software distributions may have packaged openMSX and will enable you to install it directly using package management tools. We refer to the documentation of the tools of the distribution you are using to install openMSX. If you use such a package, you can skip the largest part of this manual and start reading at chapter <a class="internal" href="#next">5. Next Steps</a>.
</p>

<p>
The level of support for compilation depends on the operating system:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Linux</dt>
<dd>
Most openMSX developers run some form of Linux, so this is the platform on which compilation is supported best.
</dd>
<dt>Windows</dt>
<dd>
Windows is also a supported platform for openMSX. Most Windows users will just download the binary release. But if you want to follow the latest developments or like to play with the code a bit, it is possible to compile openMSX on Windows yourself. For this you need MSYS and a variety of libraries.
</dd>
<dt>Mac OS X</dt>
<dd>
You can compile openMSX on Mac OS X. Nowadays we have at least one developer that runs Mac OS X and as a result support for Mac OS X has improved a lot as of openMSX 0.5.1. However, we do not have a binary package or a GUI yet, so you will have to use openMSX from the command line for now, unless you use third party software like <a class="external" href="http://www5f.biglobe.ne.jp/~nekocan/group_soft/ht_soft.html">Nekolauncher openMSX</a>.
<br />
This manual contains all the essential info to compile openMSX on Mac OS X. However, if you are not experienced in compiling software yourself, there is a nice
<a class="external" href="http://www.msxgamesbox.com/Sections/emumac/openmsx.php">article at The MSX Games bOX</a>
which explains everything in more detail. It seems to be getting a bit outdated, though, but it may still give you valuable hints.
</dd>
<dt>FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD</dt>
<dd>
openMSX was compiled successfully on FreeBSD 4 and 5 and OpenBSD. NetBSD build support is also integrated and should work as well, but we cannot easily test this. These are not platforms we support officially, but whenever a user finds compilation problems, we fix them, so usually compilation should work.
</dd>
<dt>other operating systems</dt>
<dd>
openMSX theoretically can compile on every system where you have g++ (the C++ compiler of GCC) and the required libraries are available. However, in practice every system is slightly different and a new operation system will not work out-of-the-box, especially because we have to explicitly add an integration file for each OS to support it. Still, it shouldn't take much effort to make openMSX build on a new OS.

<h2><a id="getsource">2. Getting the Source Code</a></h2>

<p>
openMSX is developed using the tools
<a class="external" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a>
freely offers to open source projects.
The code is stored in Subversion (SVN), an open source version management system.
Once in a while an openMSX release is made.
</p>

<p>
There are several options for getting the source code:
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getrelease">Released Version</a></dt>
<dd>
These are tested versions, which should give you little problem compiling
and running.
However, as openMSX development if often quite fast, they may not have all
the latest features.
Also there could be bugs that have been fixed since the last release.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getsvn">SVN Checkout</a></dt>
<dd>
Through SVN you can get the same development version the
openMSX developers are using, but it can possibly lag behind somewhat to the current state of affairs.
This is the bleeding edge:
the latest stuff, which may be great or may be horribly broken.
Usually openMSX SVN compiles and runs fine, but we're only human,
so once in a while it breaks.
Also there may be changes that are not documented yet.
</dd>

<dt><a class="internal" href="#getsnapshot">SVN Snapshot</a></dt>
<dd>
A snapshot is created from a recent SVN checkout,
in a <code>tar.gz</code> archive.
A snapshot is therefore quite similar to a SVN checkout,
but it doesn't require you to install and use SVN. It may lag a couple of days from the latest SVN sources. Moreover, SF.net staff recently turned off cron jobs, which means the snapshots are now updated on a very irregular basis.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Releases are intended for general users, SVN and SVN snapshots are intended for
(would be) developers, heavy testers and people who want to follow new
developments closely. It might be a good idea to play with a release first. If
you like what you see and want to get in deeper, you can switch to SVN later.
If you update often, it is best to use a SVN checkout rather than
a SVN snapshot, because with a checkout you can do efficient incremental
updates, saving network bandwidth and compile time.
</p>

<p>
If you downloaded a version that is either a lot older or a lot newer than
this guide, it is a good idea to read the guide included in your downloaded
version instead of the version you're reading right now.
You can find the Compilation Guide in the directory
<code>openMSX/doc/manual</code>.
</p>

<h3><a id="getrelease">2.1 Released Version</a></h3>

<p>
You can download a released version of openMSX from
<a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=38274"
>the download page at SourceForge</a>.
The latest version is probably the best one. This guide assumes that you are using the latest release.
</p>

<p>
After downloading, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf openmsx-VERSION.tar.gz</div>
<p>
in which <code>VERSION</code> is the openMSX version you downloaded,
or use the file name you saved the tar.gz file with.
The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file
is called <em>the top of the source tree</em>.
</p>

<h3><a id="getsvn">2.2 SVN Checkout</a></h3>

<p>
Getting a SVN checkout means you use SVN to retrieve the latest version
of the source code of openMSX.
This means you will need to install an SVN client.
This package is usually named <code>subversion</code>.
There are graphical front-ends for SVN,
but this guide will tell you how to use SVN from the command line.
More information about SVN can be found on the <a class="external"
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/">Subversion book</a> site. Windows
users might want to look at <a class="external"
href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>.
</p>

<p>
With the following line you can retrieve the latest sources:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
svn co https://openmsx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/openmsx/openmsx/trunk openMSX
</div>
<p>
In this line you specified where you want to retrieve the files from
(host name of the SVN server),
what project you want to retrieve (<em>openmsx</em> in this case), what
module you want to get (<em>openmsx</em> in this case, which is the module that contains
the sources of the main openMSX program), which branch you want
to retrieve (<em>trunk</em> in this case, which is the main development branch) and what directory it should be
checked out to (we chose <em>openMSX</em> in this example).
</p>

<p>
If you're a developer, it makes sense to add the following option as well:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
--username &lt;name-of-your-sourceforge-account&gt;
</div>

<p>
The SVN command created a directory called <code>openMSX</code> for you
in the current directory. In addition to the openMSX code, you will see hidden
SVN administration directories which are all called <code>svn</code> or
<code>.svn</code>.
Do not mess with these, otherwise SVN will get confused.
This directory created by SVN is what we will call in this manual <em>the top
of the source tree</em>.  
</p>

<p>
If you want to update your source tree later,
go to the top of the source tree and type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
svn up
</div>

<h3><a id="getsnapshot">2.3 SVN Snapshot</a></h3>

<p>
First, download the
<a class="external"
href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/temp/openmsx-SVN-snapshot.tar.gz"
>most recent SVN snapshot</a>.
</p>

<p>
After downloading, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">tar xzvf openmsx-SVN-snapshot.tar.gz</div>
<p>
The directory that is created by uncompressing the <code>tar.gz</code> file
is called <em>the top of the source tree</em>.
</p>

<h2><a id="compile">3. Compilation</a></h2>

<p>
Before you can start compiling openMSX, you have to make sure your system
has all the necessary build tools installed, as well as the libraries
openMSX depends upon.
The following sections list the packages you need.
</p>

<h3><a id="tools">3.1 Build Tools</a></h3>

<p>
For compilation, you need Make and a C++ compiler.
If you have compiled packages from source before,
you probably have these installed already.
</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>GNU implementation of the Make tool.
Make interprets rules that define how a project should be built.
At least version 3.79 and higher should suffice.</dd>

<dt>g++</dt>
<dd>The GNU C++ compiler.
Version 3.2 or later is recommended;
2.95 is not supported anymore as of openMSX 0.3.4.</dd>

</dl>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
Install the Xcode Tools from Apple, which you can download from the
<a class="external" href="http://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a>
(free registration required).
This package contains up-to-date versions of Make, GCC and SVN. If you are running Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), Xcode should be installable from the installation CD.
</p>

<h3><a id="libs">3.2 Libraries</a></h3>

<p>
openMSX depends on several libraries.
You must have the runtime packages of these libraries install to be
able to run openMSX.
The runtime package for the "Foo" library is typically called
<code>libfoo</code>.
Also, for compiling openMSX you need the development packages of these
libraries installed as well.
Development packages are typically named
<code>libfoo-dev</code> or <code>libfoo-devel</code>.
</p>

<p>
First of all, you need some SDL packages,
the run time ones and also the developer packages.
You need the general SDL libs and SDL_image.
The exact names of the package are different for each distribution.
On a Debian testing system, they are called:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>libsdl1.2debian and libsdl1.2-dev</dt>
<dd>Simple DirectMedia Layer.</dd>

<dt>libsdl-image1.2 and libsdl-image1.2-dev</dt>
<dd>Image loading library for SDL.</dd>

<!-- maybe in the future
<dt>libsdl-net1.2 and libsdl-net1.2-dev</dt>
<dd>Network library for SDL.</dd>
-->

</dl>

<p>
Furthermore, you need the XML library and the PNG library:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>libxml2 and libxml2-dev</dt>
<dd>XML C library, originally developed for GNOME.</dd>

<dt>libpng12-0 and libpng12-dev</dt>
<dd>Library for handling PNG images.</dd>

</dl>

<p>
Finally you will also need Tcl 8.4:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>tcl8.4 and tcl8.4-dev</dt>
<dd>Tcl (the Tool Command Language) v8.4.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Tcl 8.3 will not work.
For some reason, several distributions still ship Tcl 8.3,
even though Tcl 8.4 was released in 2002.
If that is the case for your distribution,
you should install Tcl 8.4 from source;
you can find it on
<a class="external" href="http://www.tcl.tk/">the Tcl site</a>.
</p>

<p>
openMSX can optionally use OpenGL for graphics.
If you want to use this, make sure you have both the runtime and development
packages for OpenGL installed. Since openMSX 0.6.1, we use the GLEW library (version 1.3.2 or later, 1.3.4 recommended) to handle OpenGL extensions:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>libglew1 and libglew-dev</dt>
<dd>The OpenGL Extension Wrangler.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If you have an nVidia card, go to the
<a class="external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/linux">nVidia web site</a>
for drivers, which include an OpenGL implementation. ATI users can check out the <a class="external" href="http://www.ati.com/support/faq/linux.html">ATI web site</a> for drivers. For other cards, try Mesa, which can be found in packages like
<code>libgl1-mesa-glx</code> and <code>libgl1-mesa-dev</code> (Debian)
or <code>XFree86-GLX</code> and <code>XFree86-GLX-devel</code> (SUSE).
However, nowadays there is a big chance that your system already has hardware accelerated OpenGL supported in the default installation of your Xorg or Windows environment. Just make sure you install the development header files for the OpenGL library if you want to compile openMSX with support for it.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
You can get the libraries from either
<a class="external" href="http://www.darwinports.org/">DarwinPorts</a>
or
<a class="external" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>. These are tools to give you access to a large collection of software packages (or ports). You can use them to install those packages (or ports).
If you are using DarwinPorts, you should install the ports
<code>libpng</code>, <code>libsdl</code> and <code>libsdl_image</code>.
If you are using Fink, you should install the packages
<code>libpng3</code>, <code>sdl</code> and <code>sdl-image</code>.
</p>

<h5>Microsoft Windows</h5>
<p>
If you want to build SDL yourself, please check out the patch which you can find in the directory <code>doc.dll\libSDL</code>. Apply this patch to the extracted <code>libSDL-1.2.9.zip</code>. Make sure you have the DirectX headers installed, see also <a class="external" href="http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/mingw32/README.txt">this README.txt</a>. After that, build it like this: 
</p>

<div class="commandline">
./autogen.sh<br/>
./configure --enable-stdio-redirect=no<br/>
make<br/>
make install 
</div>

<p>
The other libraries can be downloaded in binary and source form from several places.
</p>

<h3><a id="compilenow">3.3 Compilation Itself</a></h3>

<p>
Now that all the necessary tools and libraries are installed,
you are almost ready to start the actual compilation of openMSX.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you may want to know is that you can build openMSX in
different flavours. The default flavour for each platform will
probably OK for most cases. For the Linux-on-x86 platform the default
flavour is "i686": i.e., with optimisations for Pentium II and higher,
without any debugging stuff. If you are a tester, you should set the
flavour to "devel", like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
export OPENMSX_FLAVOUR=devel
</div>
<p>
This will enable debugging symbols and asserts. Although the default
flavours will probably be OK for most cases, you may want to write a
specific flavour for your particular wishes. Check out the examples in
the <code>build</code> directory. A final note: on an older VIA Epia (with the
Samuel 2 CPU at least), a binary built with i686 flavour will not run. Please
use the "opt" flavour for that platform.
</p>

<p>
Now, we have the option to let a script check if you have indeed all
necessary libraries and headers installed.
Go to the top of your openMSX source tree and run the following script:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
./configure
</div>
<p>
This script will report what versions of libraries you have installed.
It also reports which components can be built with those libraries.
If the script reports that it can't build the openMSX core component,
you should install the missing ones before you can continue.
Otherwise, you can decide to install the libraries needed for the optional
components, or to continue without building some components (e.g. the OpenGL based renderers).
</p>

<p>
If installing the correct libraries doesn't help,
<a class="internal" href="#contact">contact the openMSX developers</a>.
If you file a bug report, please attach the <code>probe.log</code> file
that is written by the <code>configure</code> script in the directory
<code>derived/[PLATFORM]-[FLAVOUR]/config/</code>.
</p>

<p>
You can customise the build process by editing the file
<code>build/custom.mk</code>.
Currently, there is one thing you can customise there:
the installation directory (<code>INSTALL_BASE</code>).
If you are installing openMSX on a system on which you do not have
superuser (root) privileges, you can set the installation directory
to a subdirectory of your home directory.
</p>

<p>
After successfully running <code>configure</code>,
it's time to compile everything.
To start compilation, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make
</div>
<p>
Depending on how fast your system is,
this may take several minutes to half an hour.
</p>

<p>
If you get errors during compilation,
there may be something wrong that was not detected by configure.
Verify that you installed
<a class="internal" href="#libs">all required libraries</a>,
both the run time and development packages.
If that doesn't help, or we forgot to list a library openMSX depends on,
<a class="internal" href="#contact">contact the openMSX developers</a>.
Make sure you provide us with the error message you got.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
The steps above apply to Mac OS X as well.
If you have a G4 or better CPU, using <code>export OPENMSX_FLAVOUR=ppcg4</code> may give you a faster openMSX executable.
</p>

<h2><a id="install">4. Installation</a></h2>

<p>
To install openMSX, run the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
make install
</div>
<p>
This installs openMSX, by default in <code>/opt/openMSX</code>.
Note that only root has rights to write to system-wide directories such as
<code>/opt</code>,
so you may have to do <code>su</code> before <code>make install</code>.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
The easiest way to install openMSX system-wide is this command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
sudo make install
</div>

<h2><a id="next">5. Next Steps</a></h2>

<p>
If all went well, you should have openMSX installed now.
You can test it by executing openMSX from the command line:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
openmsx
</div>

<p>
You should get a screen similar to this:
</p>
<div class="commandline"><pre>
C-BIOS 0.21        cbios.sf.net

No cartridge found.

This version of C-BIOS can
only start cartrdiges.
Please restart your MSX
(emulator) with a cartridge
inserted.
</pre></div>

<p>
C-BIOS MSX2+ is the default system BIOS used by openMSX.
It was written from scratch by BouKiCHi and he was kind enough to let us
distribute it together with openMSX.
It is not perfect yet, but it runs many ROM games well.
Nowadays C-BIOS is a separate SourceForge.net project, with its own <a class="external" href="http://cbios.sourceforge.net/">web page</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you have a ROM image ready, you can try to run it with C-BIOS:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
openmsx ~/msx/games/my-favourite-game.rom
</div>

<p>
The next step would be to read the
<a class="external" href="setup.html">openMSX Setup Guide</a>.
That document describes how you can configure openMSX to emulate
actual MSX machines, such as the Panasonic FS-A1GT (turboR).
It also describes how you can have openMSX start up with your
personal settings, how you can configure openMSX and your system
for optimal performance and several other configuration related
topics.
And finally there is of course the
<a class="external" href="user.html">openMSX User's Manual</a>,
which describes all the things you can do with openMSX once
it is fully running.
</p>

<p>
If you got stuck somewhere in the compilation and installation process,
please contact us. The next chapter will tell you how.
</p>

<h5>Mac OS X</h5>
<p>
By default openMSX will not be in your search path.
So to start it, you will have to specify the full path on the command line.
For example:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
/opt/openMSX/bin/openmsx
</div>

<h2><a id="contact">6. Contact Info</a></h2>

<li>
Post a message on the forum on <a class="external" href="http://www.openmsx.org/">www.openmsx.org</a><!-- or the <a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=38274">openMSX forums</a> at SourceForge-->.

<p>
For experienced users: if you get a crash,
try to provide a <code>gdb</code> backtrace.
This will only work if you did not strip the openMSX binary
of its debug symbols.

Another useful thing to do is to install the debug versions of libstdc++ and libc6,
and then run openmsx with an <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/debug</code> exported in the environment.
This will give a more detailed stacktrace, especially in optimized code.
</p>

<p>
In any case, try to give as much information as possible when you describe your
bug or request.
