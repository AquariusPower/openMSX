<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1. New Versions of this Document</a></h3>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/manual/">http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use this URL to get up-to-date versions of the hyper links
if you printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2. Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This guide is about openMSX, the open source MSX emulator that tries to achieve
near-perfect emulation by using a novel emulation model.
You can find more information about openMSX on the
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sourceforge.net/">openMSX home page</a>.
You can also download the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all
features are implemented yet.
Many emulation features are implemented, but in terms of user interface
it is rather bare bones.
However, since the emulation is already pretty good,
it would be nice if non-insiders would be able to play with it, too.
For those people, we have written this guide.
It explains how you can get the emulator running on your system,
i.e. how to get the sources and compile them.
</p>

<p>
This guide describes the setup of openMSX.
After installation,
openMSX is ready to run using C-BIOS and the default settings.
In this guide you can read how to configure openMSX
to emulate actual MSX machines (such as Panasonic FS-A1GT).
It also describes how you can have openMSX start up
with your personal settings,
how you can configure openMSX and your system for optimal performance
and several other configuration related topics.
</p>

<p>
<em>Disclaimer:</em>
We do not claim this guide is complete or even correct.
What you do with the information in it is entirely at your own risk.
We just hope it helps you enjoy openMSX more.

<h2><a id="machext">2. Machines and Extensions</a></h2>

<p>
We use the word <em>machine</em> to refer to a specific
MSX model. For example, the Sony HB-75P is a machine.
openMSX does not have a fixed machine hardcoded into it.
Instead, many different MSX machines can be emulated.
The details of a machine are described in an XML file.
This file describes how much memory a machine has,
what video processor it has, in which slots its system ROMs are located,
whether the machine has a built-in disk drive etc.
openMSX reads the machine description XML and will then emulate exactly
that MSX machine, which can be anything from an MSX1 with 16K of RAM
to the MSXturboR GT.
</p>

<p>
The openMSX distribution contains XML files describing many existing MSX
models.
You can find them in the <code>share/machines</code> directory.
If you want to run one of those machines,
you also need the system ROMs for that machine.
See the <a class="internal" href="#systemroms">next chapter</a> for more
information on system ROMs.
You can also create your own machine descriptions,
to expand existing MSX models or to create your own fantasy MSX. There is currently one such a fantasy MSX configuration that is based on a real MSX shipped with openMSX. It is called "Boosted_MSX2_EN", since it is a European MSX2 with loads of hardware built in. You can find some more information about it in the README file which is in its directory <code>share/machines/Boosted_MSX2_EN</code>.
More about creating fantasy MSX machines in a
<a class="internal" href="#hardwareedit">later chapter</a>.
</p>

<p>
An <em>extension</em> is a piece of MSX hardware that can be
inserted into a cartridge slot to extend the capabilities of an MSX.
Examples of extensions are the Panasonic FMPAC, the Sunrise IDE interface
and an external 4MB memory mapper.
Extensions, like machines, are described in XML files.
You can find a lot of predefined extensions
in the <code>share/extensions</code> directory.
Some extensions need ROM images in order to run, similar to system ROMs.
</p>

<h2><a id="systemroms">3. System ROMs</a></h2>

<p>
An MSX machine consists of a lot of hardware, but also contains some software.
Such software includes the BIOS, MSX-BASIC, software controlling disk drives
and built-in applications (firmware).
openMSX emulates the MSX hardware, but it needs MSX system software to emulate
a full MSX system.
Because the internal software is located in ROM chips, it is referred to as
<em>system ROMs</em>.
</p>

<p>
The software in the system ROMs, like most software, is copyrighted.
Depending on your local laws, there are certain things you are allowed to
do with copyrighted software and certain things you are not allowed to do.
In this manual, a couple of options are listed for providing system ROMs
to your openMSX installation.
It is up to you, the user, to select an option that is legal in your country.
</p>

<h3><a id="cbios">3.1. C-BIOS</a></h3>

<p>
C-BIOS stands for "Compatible BIOS".
It tries to be compatible with the MSX BIOS found in real MSX machines,
but it was written from scratch, so all copyrights belong to its authors.
BouKiChi, the original author of C-BIOS, was kind enough to allow C-BIOS
to be distributed together with openMSX.
Since then, Reikan took over maintenance of C-BIOS and the license
was changed to give users and developers even more freedom in using C-BIOS.
Every now and then, an updated version of C-BIOS is released.
You can wait for it to be included in the next openMSX release,
or download it directly from the
<a class="external" href="http://www.ranpub.com/CBIOS/">C-BIOS home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
C-BIOS can be used to run most MSX1 and MSX2 cartridge-based games.
It does not include MSX-BASIC and does not support disk drives,
so programs depending on that will not run.
openMSX contains two machine configurations using C-BIOS.
The machine <code>cbios-msx1</code> is an MSX1 with 64K RAM.
The machine <code>cbios-msx2</code> is an MSX2 with 512K RAM and 128K VRAM.
The latter is the default machine for openMSX after installation,
so if you change nothing to the openMSX configuration,
then <code>cbios-msx2</code> is the machine that will be booted.
</p>

<p>
It is always legal for you to run the C-BIOS ROMs in openMSX.
You are allowed to use C-BIOS and its source code in various other ways
as well, read the C-BIOS license for details.
It is located in the files <code>cbios.txt</code> (Japanese) and
<code>cbios.en.txt</code> (English).
</p>

<h3><a id="dumprom">3.2. Dumping ROMs</a></h3>

<p>
If you own a real MSX machine, you can dump the contents of its system ROMs
to create ROM images you can run in openMSX.
This way, you can emulate the MSX machines you are familiar with.
</p>

<h4><a id="dumpromtools">3.2.1 Tools</a></h4>

<p>
The easiest way to dump system ROMs is to run special dumping tool on your
real MSX, which copies the contents of the system ROMs to disk.
Sean Young has made such tools, you can find the
<a class="external" href="http://www.msxnet.org/utils/saverom">tools and documentation</a>
on his web site.
These tools can also be used to dump cartridge ROMs, which may be useful later,
if you want to use certain extensions or play games.
</p>

<h4><a id="dumpromlocation">3.2.2 ROM Locations</a></h4>

<p>
When the ROMs are dumped, you have a disk with a number of ROM images.
Copy these images to the subdirectory called <code>roms</code> in the
machine directory.
For example, if you dumped the ROMs of a Philips NMS 8250 machine,
copy them to <code>share/machines/Philips_NMS_8250/roms</code>.
Look in the file hardwareconfig.xml for the file names openMSX expects
the ROM images to have.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, since openMSX 0.5.0 there is an easier way. These
versions support ROM pools: special directories where openMSX will look
for ROM files. The default ROM pool is the <code>share/systemroms</code>
directory. So, if you're using 0.5.0 or higher, you can just as well
put all your system ROMs in that directory.
</p>

<h4><a id="dumpromsplit">3.2.3 How to handle split ROMs</a></h4>

<p>
The machine configurations bundled with openMSX often refer to ROM files
that span multiple 16K pages.
For example, in the NMS 8250 configuration, the BIOS and MSX-BASIC are
expected in a single 32K ROM image.
If you created two 16K images when dumping, you can concatenate them
using tools included with your OS.
In Linux and other Unix(-like) systems you can do it like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
cat bios.rom basic.rom &gt; nms8250_basic-bios2.rom
</div>
<p>
In Windows, open a command prompt and issue this command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
copy /b bios.rom + basic.rom nms8250_basic-bios2.rom
</div>

<h4><a id="dumpromchecksums">3.2.4 Checksums</a></h4>
<p>
You can check whether you have the same images as the machine configuration
was tested with using the <code>SHA1SUMS</code> file.
This file contains checksums of ROM images that are known to work.
You can compare the checksums of your ROM images to this file with the
<code>sha1sum</code> tool.
It is installed by default on most Linux systems,
on Windows you would have to download it separately.
If the checksums match, it is almost certain you have correct system ROMs.
If the checksums do not match, it could mean something went wrong
dumping the ROMs, or it could mean you have a slightly older/newer model
which contains different system ROMs.
</p>

<p>
In openMSX versions from 0.5.0 the sha1sums are also included in the
machine configuration files. This enables openMSX to find the right ROM
file from one of the ROM pools. If the ROM is explicitly specified in
the configuration file and the sha1sum doesn't match a warning will be
printed.
</p>

<h4><a id="dumpromlegal">3.2.5 Legal Issues</a></h4>

<p>
Using ROMs dumped from machines you own is generally considered
a proper thing to do in the MSX community.
When the MSX machine was bought in a shop years ago, you or the person that
originally bought it paid money for the MSX machine.
A small part of that money paid for the software in the system ROMs.
However, we are no legal experts, so it is up to you to check whether it
is legal in your country to use dumped ROMs of machines you own.
</p>

<h3><a id="downloadrom">3.3. Downloading ROMs</a></h3>

<p>
Some WWW and FTP sites offer MSX system ROMs as a download.
Some MSX emulators include system ROMs in their distribution.
Downloaded system ROMs can be used in the same way as
system ROMs you dumped yourself, see the previous section.
</p>

<p>
It may be illegal in your country to download system ROMs.
Please inform yourself of the legal aspects before considering this option.
Whatever you decide, is your own responsibility.
</p>

<h2><a id="settings">4. User Preferences</a></h2>

<p>
Since openMSX 0.5.0, almost all user preferences can be done via the console, at openMSX run time. See also <a class="external" href="user.html#controlling">the User's Manual</a>. You can save your settings with the <code>save_settings</code> command, which will save the settings in <code>~/.openMSX/share/settings.xml</code> (UNIX) or <code>My Documents\openMSX\share\settings.xml</code> (Windows), your personal settings file. The settings file will be loaded every time openMSX starts. You can still manually edit this file, but it is not necessary anymore: just edit the settings from the console.
</p>

<p>
One of the preferences is the default machine:
the machine openMSX uses if you did not specify one on the command line. The name of this setting is <code>machine</code>.
</p>

<p>
A convenient setting is called <code>user_directories</code>. With this setting you can specify directories in which openMSX should look for to find
files that you mention on the command line or in the openMSX console.
If
you have some big directory with a lot of disk images, e.g., you can add the path to the TCL list that holds the user directories with this setting, so that you don't have to specify the whole path anymore. Use this to make things just a little more comfortable. For example: <code>set user_directories "~/diskimages /mnt/datadisk/MSX-soft/diskimages ~/.openMSX/ROMs ~/.openMSX"</code> specifies four user directories in which is searched.
</p>

<p>
By using the <code>bind</code> command you can create custom key bindings. These bindings will also be saved as settings in your settings file if you issue a <code>save_settings</code> command.
</p>


<!--
<p>
You can also register more file extensions in the <code>settings.xml</code> file.
See the "FileTypes" section of the file.
</p>
-->

<p>
The other settings are discussed in <a class="external" href="user.html#controlling">the User's Manual</a> and in the file <code>doc/commands.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
Previous versions of openMSX also had a possibility to specify <code>AutoCommands</code>. If you still want to let openMSX execute commands at start up, add those commands to the <code>init.tcl</code> file. This file can be placed in
exactly the same directories as the <code>settings.xml</code> file. Note that you can put any Tcl command there, so you can also use it to specify aliases, for example.
</p>

<h2><a id="hardwareedit">5. Writing Machine Descriptions</a></h2>

<p>
There are two ways to use extra devices in your emulated MSX:
you can use an extension
(which is analogous to inserting a cartridge with the device into the MSX)
or you can modify the hardware configuration file
(which is analogous to open the MSX and build in the device).
As in the real world, extensions are easier to use,
but modifying the machine gives you more possibilities.
Using extensions is covered in the
<a class="external" href="user.html">User's Manual</a>;
this chapter tells you how you can create or modify machine descriptions.
By editing the XML files, you can for example increase the amount of RAM,
add a built-in MSX-MUSIC, add a disk drive, create extra cartridge slots etc.
</p>

<p>
You can modify an MSX machine (e.g. to add devices) by editing the XML config
file. So, let's make a copy of <code>machines/Philips_NMS_8250/hardwareconfig.xml</code> and
put it in <code>machines/mymsx/</code> under the name of <code>hardwareconfig.xml</code>.
It's the config we are going to play with; our custom MSX.
Note: it is convenient to use the directory
<code>~/.openMSX/share/machines</code> (UNIX) or <code>My
Documents\openMSX\share\machines</code> (Windows) to store your home-made machines,
instead of the openMSX installation directory.
</p>

<p>
There is a special config file in the source tree that isn't usable by itself,
but contains XML fragments of some possible devices currently implemented in
openMSX. This file is called <code>exampleconfigs.xml</code> and is currently located in
the directory <code>doc/</code>. It is very convenient to copy and paste
parts of it to your own <code>mymsx/hardwareconfig.xml</code>. Of course, you can also use
fragments from other existing configurations that can be found in
<code>share/machines</code> or <code>share/extensions</code>.
</p>

<p>
To add an FMPAC to the 8250, just copy this part from the <code>exampleconfigs.xml</code> to
some place in your <code>mymsx/hardwareconfig.xml</code> file (between the <code>&lt;devices&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/devices&gt;</code> tags!):
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;primary slot="2"&gt;
      &lt;secondary slot="0"&gt;
        &lt;FMPAC id="PanaSoft SW-M004 FMPAC"&gt;
          &lt;io base="0x7C" num="2" type="O"/&gt;
          &lt;mem base="0x4000" size="0x4000"/&gt;
          &lt;sound&gt;
            &lt;volume&gt;13000&lt;/volume&gt;
            &lt;mode&gt;left&lt;/mode&gt;
          &lt;/sound&gt;
          &lt;rom&gt;
            &lt;sha1&gt;9d789166e3caf28e4742fe933d962e99618c633d&lt;/sha1&gt;
            &lt;filename&gt;roms/fmpac.rom&lt;/filename&gt;
          &lt;/rom&gt;
          &lt;sramname&gt;fmpac.pac&lt;/sramname&gt;
        &lt;/FMPAC&gt;
      &lt;/secondary&gt;
    &lt;/primary&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Don't forget to add the <code>fmpac.rom</code> file to the roms directory of
your machine, or add the file with the mentioned sha1sum to one of your ROM
pools.
</p>

<p>
You can of course do some things differently, if you like.
The number in <code>slot</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;primary&gt;</code> tag indicates the
primary slot of the emulated MSX you're editing. In this case the second
cartridge slot of the NMS-8250 is used. <code>&lt;secondary&gt;</code> means sub slot. Our NMS-8250
doesn't have an expanded slot in slot 2, so we have to specify 0 here. (If a <code>&lt;primary&gt;</code>
tag has the attribute <code>external="true"</code>, this means that the slot is
expanded; a normal 8250 has slot 3 expanded.)
As explained above, the parameter filename can be adjusted to the name of your (64kB!) FMPAC ROM
file (note: if the file is not 64kB (65536 bytes) in size, it won't work).
"mode" defines to what channel the FMPAC's sound will be routed by
default.
"sramname" specifies the file name for file in which the SRAM contents will be
saved to or loaded from. The saved files are compatible with the files that are
saved by the (real) FMPAC commander's save option.
</p>

<p>
After saving your config and running openMSX again, you should be able to get
the FMPAC commander with <code>CALL FMPAC</code> in the emulated MSX!
</p>

<p>
In a similar fashion, you can also add an MSX-Audio device
(<code>&lt;MSX-AUDIO&gt;</code>, note that some programs also need the
<code>MusicModuleMIDI</code> device to
detect the Music Module; this device is at the moment not fully implemented
though), an empty SCC cartridge (<code>&lt;SCC&gt;</code>), etc. Just
browse the <code>exampleconfigs.xml</code> file, the Boosted_MSX2_EN
configuration file or the extensions and see what you can find.
</p>

<p>
Devices that contain ROM or RAM will have to be put inside a slot of the MSX,
using the <code>&lt;primary&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;secondary&gt;</code> tags
as is demonstrated with the above mentioned FMPAC example. Other devices don't
need this. 
Remember that you can not put two devices that have a ROM in the same (sub)slot!
Just use a new free subslot if you need to add such a device and all your
primary slots are full. Devices that do not need a slot, like the MSX-Audio
device, you can add as many as you like.
</p>

<p>
Another thing you may want to change: the amount of RAM of the MSX: change the
"size" parameter in the <code>&lt;MemoryMapper&gt;</code> device config.
</p>

<p>
If you understand the basics of XML, you should be able to compose your MSX now!
You can use the ready-made configurations in <code>share/machines</code> as
examples.
</p>

<h2><a id="tuning">6. Performance Tuning</a></h2>

<p>
This chapter contains some tips for tuning the performance of openMSX
on your system.
</p>

<h3><a id="opengl">6.1. OpenGL</a></h3>

<p>
The SDLGL renderer needs hardware acceleration to run at a decent speed.
If your OpenGL driver is not hardware accelerated,
use the SDLHi renderer instead.
If you have hardware accelerated OpenGL, but an older graphics card,
try disabling scanlines, blur and glow (set them to 0).
</p>
<p>
For OpenGL under Linux, you might have to take some additional steps to get it hardware accelerated.
If you have an nVidia card, go to the
<a class="external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/linux">nVidia web site</a>
for drivers, which include an OpenGL implementation. ATI users can check out the <a class="external" href="http://www.ati.com/support/faq/linux.html">ATI web site</a> for drivers.
For other cards, try Mesa, which can be found in packages like
<code>xlibmesa-gl</code> and <code>xlibmesa-gl-dev</code> (Debian)
or <code>XFree86-GLX</code> and <code>XFree86-GLX-devel</code> (SUSE).
</p>
<p>
You need to have the GLX module loaded in your X server and
also accelerated graphics (DRI).
You can verify this by typing <code>glxinfo</code> on the command line.
</p>

<h3><a id="tuningvarious">6.2. Various Tuning Tips</a></h3>

<p>
CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX
settings and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating.
Some things run fine on a 200MHz machine, others are slow on a 2GHz
machine.
</p>

<p>
If openMSX runs slow, you can try the following measures:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure there are no CPU or I/O heavy background processes is running.
Downloads, P2P software, distributed calculation efforts, search indexers etc may grab
the CPU from time to time, leaving less time for openMSX to do its job.
Even if they only do so only once in a while, it may be enough to cause
emulation to stutter. 
</li>
<li>
Use 16-bit colour mode instead of 32-bit.
openMSX uses your platform's default setting.
</li>
<li>
Use line accuracy (default) instead of pixel accuracy.
Pixel accuracy can be slow in worst-case situations, while it is only really
needed for a couple of demos (Unknown Reality, Verti). Pixel accuracy is
default, though, since it enables the most accurate emulation.
</li>
<li>
Increase the number of frames that may be skipped ("set maxframeskip 10", for example).
</li>
<li>
Use the low-res SDLLo renderer (75% less pixels to fill). For most
games (and any MSX1 software) it works perfectly, especially when using full screen.
</li>
<li>
Use a lower sound mixing frequency, for example 22050Hz instead of 44100Hz. Use
the <code>frequency</code> setting for this.
</li>
<li>
Use less sound channels, for example use MSX-MUSIC (maximum 9 channels)
instead of MoonSound (maximum 18+24 channels).
</li>
</ul>

<!--

<h3><a id="linuxrtc">6.2. Timing using the Real Time Clock (Linux)</a></h3>

<p>
If you find the openMSX timing bad (i.e. too irregular),
you may want to enable RealTimeClock (RTC) based timing.
This feature is only available in the Linux version of openMSX.
</p>

<p>
Most Linux systems need some configuration before the RTC is usable.
You will have to have read permission to the device <code>/dev/rtc</code>
on your system
(which maybe a symlink to <code>/dev/misc/rtc</code> or something else).
You should also have RTC support in your kernel or loaded as a kernel module.
After arranging this, you will also need to type the following as root:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
echo 1024 &gt; /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq
</div>
<p>
or add it to your system startup scripts.
This line gives user processes, such as openMSX, permission to configure
the RTC to generate interrupts at frequencies up to 1024Hz.
</p>

<p>
openMSX will try to use RTC timing by default, but if that fails,
it prints a warning and falls back to the less accurate SDL timing.

<p>
Since openMSX is still in heavy development, feedback and bug reports are very
welcome!
</p>

<p>
If you encounter problems, you have several options:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
If you're a regular user and want to discuss openMSX and possible problems,
join our <code>openmsx-user</code> mailing list.
More info on the
<a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=38274">openMSX mailing lists</a>,
including an archive of old messages, can be found at SourceForge.
</li>
<li>
Go to our IRC channel: <code>#openMSX</code> on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
and ask your question there.
</li>
<li>
If you want to address the openMSX developers directly,
post a message to the <code>openmsx-devel</code> mailing list.

<li>
Use one of the
<a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=38274">openMSX trackers</a>
at SourceForge.
At the moment of writing, there are four trackers:
Bugs, Support Requests, Patches and Feature Requests.
</li>
<li>
Post a message on the <a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=38274">openMSX forums</a> at SourceForge.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For experienced users: if you get a crash,
try to provide a <code>gdb</code> backtrace.
This will only work if you did not strip the openMSX binary
of its debug symbols.
</p>

<p>
In any case, try to give as much information as possible when you describe your
bug or request.
