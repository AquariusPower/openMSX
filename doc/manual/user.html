<h2><a id="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a id="newver">1.1. New Versions of this Document</a></h3>
<p>
The latest version of the openMSX manual can be found on the openMSX home page:
</p>
<p>
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/">http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/</a>
</p>
<p>
You can also use this URL to get up-to-date versions of the hyperlinks
if you printed out this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="purpose">1.2. Purpose</a></h3>
<p>
This manual is about openMSX, the open source MSX emulator that tries to achieve
near-perfect emulation by using a novel emulation model.
You can find more information about openMSX on the
<a class="external" href="http://openmsx.sf.net/">openMSX home page</a>.
You can also download the emulator itself from there.
</p>

<p>
openMSX is in alpha state, which means that some things work but not all
features are implemented yet.
Many emulation features are implemented, but in terms of user interface
it is rather bare bones.
However, since the emulation is already pretty good,
it would be nice if non-insiders would be able to play with it, too.
For those people, we have written this guide.
It explains how you can make use of the features of the emulator, once you have got it running.
</p>

<p>
This manual tells you how you can use openMSX, once it has been installed and properly set up. You should be able to use most of the features of openMSX if you have read it.
</p>

<p>
<em>Disclaimer:</em>
We do not claim this guide is complete or even correct.
What you do with the information in it is entirely at your own risk.
We just hope it helps you enjoy openMSX more.

<h2><a id="starting">2. Starting the Emulator</a></h2>

<p>
If you start openMSX without any command line parameters, you will get the default machine, which you have set up in <code>settings.xml</code>, see <a class="external" href="setup.html">Setup Guide</a>. When you use the shipped file, this means you will get a machine that uses C-BIOS. In this chapter we will tell you how to use other machines and how to use extensions.
</p>

<h3><a id="machines">2.1. Machines</a></h3>

<p>
To use a specific MSX machine that is present on your system (i.e. your openMSX installation), simply use the <code>-machine</code> command line argument, like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    openmsx -machine Panasonic_FS-A1GT
</div>

<h3><a id="extensions">2.2. Extensions</a></h3>

<p>
Extensions are simply MSX cartridges (extensions to the MSX system) that you can plug into the emulated MSX. In the next paragraph we explain this using an example.
</p>

<p>
If you have setup an FM PAC <code>hardwareconfig.xml</code> file in
<code>~/.openMSX/share/extensions/fmpac</code> e.g. (i.e. for Linux: in your custom extensions directory in this case), you can add  <code>-ext
fmpac</code> to your command line to use an FM PAC. But, as I just said, you
need to have a hardware description in that subdirectory of
<code>share/extensions/</code>, see <a class="external" href="setup.html">Setup Guide</a>. Fortunately,
openMSX comes with a predefined FM-PAC extension. You only need to add the
<code>fmpac.rom</code> in <code>share/extensions/fmpac/roms/</code>; it's the ROM that is built in the FM-PAC. If you look at that <code>share/extensions</code>
directory, you will find more extensions. E.g. using <code>-ext mbstereo</code>
gives you the Moonblaster stereo effect: FM PAC on one channel and MSX Audio on
the other. Try them out, if you like, but again, keep in mind that some
extensions need a ROM image installed in their <code>roms/</code> directory, which is explained in the <a class="external" href="setup.html">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="otheroptions">2.3. Other Command Line Options</a></h3>

<p>
Often used other command line options will be discussed later in this manual. For a complete list of them, type the following command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">openmsx -h</div>


<h2><a id="controlling">3 The Console and Settings</a></h2>

<h3><a id="console">3.1. Console Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
openMSX has a built-in command interface called the <em>console</em>,
which allows you to control various aspects of openMSX while it is running.
You can access the console by pressing F10
(with default key mapping) when the focus is on the emulator window.
This will give you a command line in the openMSX window.
</p>

<p>
Typing <code>help</code> gives a list of commands.
If you type <code>help [command]</code> you will get help
for the specified command.
This manual describes a few important commands;
a full list can be found in the file <code>doc/commands.txt</code>.
The console is mostly used to change disk images, plug in joysticks or mice,
change settings and to change key bindings.
</p>

<p>
One very practical feature of the console command line is that you can use "completion" features. Just try typing half a command and then press the TAB key; openMSX will then try to finish the word you were typing or show the possibilities in case of ambiguities. You can use it also for file names, connectors, pluggables and settings.
</p>

<!--
<p class="todo">
Add the complete list of commands from commands.txt somewhere.
</p>
-->

<h3><a id="importantconsole">3.2. Some Simple Console Commands</a></h3>

<p>
You can reset your MSX with the Console command <code>reset</code> and quit openMSX with the command <code>quit</code>. Other commands will be discussed later on in this manual.
</p>

<h3><a id="settings">3.3. Settings</a></h3>

<p>
An interesting console command is <code>set</code>. You can use it to change the various
settings. E.g., you can use it to set the renderer that is to be used. If you use it without parameters, you will get a list of settings. If you issue set with only the setting (like <code>set renderer</code>, you will get the current value of that setting.
Settings that have only two possible values can also be toggled with the <code>toggle</code>
command (an example is the default key binding of Print Screen to <code>toggle
fullscreen</code>, see also below). A complete list of settings should also be in the file
<code>commands.txt</code> in the doc directory. Note that using the "tab completion" feature can help you a lot in getting an idea of what settings are possible, as it will only complete possible options. Just try that.
</p>
<!--
<p class="todo">
Add the complete list of settings in commands.txt somewhere.<br/>
</p>
-->


<h4><a id="importantsettings">3.3.1. Some Simple But Important Settings</a></h4>

<p>
If the MSX goes too fast or too slow, adjust the emulation speed with the
<code>speed</code> setting, which has the speed percentage as parameter. So, typing <code>set
speed 120</code>, will let the emulated MSX run at 120% of normal MSX speed. This is useful for debugging purposes (slow down) or when you want to skip certain parts of a demo for example (speed up).
</p>

<p>
If you got the MSX sped up to maximum (<code>set throttle off</code>), but openMSX is still not going fast enough for you, you can increase the frameskip setting: <code>set
frameskip 10</code> will mean that openMSX draws only 1 out of 10 screens to be displayed. Of course this makes emulation a lot less accurate.
</p>

<p>
Some MSX machines like the Panasonic FS-A1GT have built in software, that can be switched on and off via a switch on the machine itself. In openMSX the internal software is switched off by default, but you can switch it on with the following setting: <code>set frontswitch on</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you want openMSX to emulate the blinking interlace effect as can be seen on a
real MSX, try <code>set deinterlace off</code>... I recommend to turn it on though, the
blinking is quite irregular on most systems and thus a pain for the eyes
(unless you combine it with the <code>glow</code> effect in SDLGL, see the <a class="internal" href="#renderers">renderers section</a>).
</p>



<h4><a id="renderers">3.3.2. Renderers</a></h4>

<p>
At the moment, there are three working renderers. A renderer is a part of the
emulator that generates the graphical part of the emulation: the MSX 'screen'.
</p>

<p>
The default renderer is called SDLHi. This one uses a window of 640&times;480
pixels to be able to display all the screen lines, even when interlacing is used
on the MSX. This renderer is not using any hardware acceleration and has a
steady CPU time consumption. The CPU load can be quite high though. It is about
50% on Manuel's Athlon XP 1600+, when emulating a 3.5MHz MSX.
</p>

<p>
A very good alternative for the SDLHi renderer is called SDLGL.
This renderer uses the OpenGL graphics library to optimize the rendering.
Because part of the rendering is done by the graphics hardware,
the CPU load can vary a lot.
The SDLGL renderer is only useful if you have a hardware accelerated
OpenGL library; a software GL implementation will be very slow.
</p>

<p>
When using the SDLGL renderer, openMSX can do some special effects on the
emulated MSX screen, such as <code>blur</code>, <code>glow</code> (afterglow!)
and <code>scanline</code>, to imitate a TV screen.
Each of these effects has an associated setting, where you can control its
level: how much blur should be applied to the picture, how dark should the
scanlines be etc.
</p>

<p>
On Linux, you need to have the GLX module loaded in your X server and
also accelerated graphics (DRI).
You can verify this by typing <code>glxinfo</code> on the command line.
SDLGL runs fine on nVidia GeForce cards using nVidia's binary graphics driver
for Linux.
If you install the right drivers for hardware acceleration, ATI Radeon cards
work fine as well.
If you compiled openMSX from source, the GL renderer is only available
when the OpenGL development files (<code>gl.h</code> is one of them)
were installed on the computer at compile time.
This will be checked by the <code>configure</code> script.
</p>

<p>
The third working renderer is called SDLLo. This renderer uses a window of only
320&times;240 pixels, which means that part of the MSX screen will be omitted. An
'interpolation' (blending) algorithm to reduce this problem was added for 16
and 24bpp visuals. I don't recommend to use this renderer, unless you have an
extremely slow computer.
</p>

<p>
You can set the renderer in the <code>settings.xml</code> file. Look for <code>&lt;config
id="renderer"&gt;</code>.  You can also specify there whether the emulator should switch
to full screen when started. You can also switch renderer from the console.
</p>

<h4><a id="accuracy">3.3.3. Renderer Accuracy</a></h4>

<p>
Another example of the settings that you can specify in the Console is the
accuracy of the rendering. There are three options: <code>screen</code>, <code>line</code> and
<code>pixel</code>. The latter is the slowest, but most accurate setting (it also shows
that the timing in openMSX is not perfect yet): it will enable you to run the
Unknown Reality real time oscilloscope almost flawlessly!  Just type <code>set
accuracy pixel</code> in the console. You can use the default <code>line</code> accuracy for
almost every other piece of software. <code>screen</code> is the fastest, but least
accurate setting. This will break a lot of software that uses raster effects.
</p>


<h4><a id="setsound">3.3.4. Sound Settings</a></h4>

<p>
For all sound devices that are available in the MSX you are emulating, there are two settings available: the volume setting and the mode setting. The latter is only available for mono sound devices; you can use it to set the channel mode to left, right or mono (both channels). Example: <code>set psg_mode left</code> or <code>set cassetteplayer_volume 0</code>.
</p>

<h3><a id="plug">3.4. Plug</a></h3>

<p>
The console command <code>plug</code> can be used to plug the so called pluggables (devices) into connectors on the MSX. Examples of connectors are the joystick ports, the printer port, the MIDI in and out connector, the cassette port, etc. Examples of pluggables are joysticks and mice (see below), but also printer loggers and MIDI equipment. The command <code>plug</code> without any parameters will show a list of connectors and what pluggables are plugged into them. Using <code>plug [connector]</code> will only show what is plugged into [connector]. You will not be surprised that the command <code>plug [connector] [pluggable]</code> will plug the [pluggable] into the [connector].
</p>

<p>
Note that using the "tab completion" feature can help you a lot in getting an idea of what plug commands are possible, as it will only complete possible connectors and their possible pluggables. Also just try this.
</p>

<!--
<p class="todo">
Add the complete list of pluggables here.
</p>
-->

<h2><a id="media">4. Running Media</a></h2>

<p>
With this information, you can run most of the existing MSX software.
</p>

<h3><a id="roms">4.1. Running ROM software</a></h3>

<p>
Suppose you want to run the ROM file <code>galious.rom</code>. Then you simply type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">openmsx galious.rom</div>
<p>
and the emulated MSX will run the game. (Of course,
in this case, the file <code>galious.rom</code> should be in the current directory or in one
of the UserDirectories you specified in the <code>settings.xml</code>, see the <a class="external" href="setup.html">Setup Guide</a>.)
</p>

<p>
If things go terribly wrong, openMSX may not have the .rom extension registered
as a ROM image (it does have that by default, though, but this is just an
example). You can then indicate this by typing:
</p>
<div class="commandline">openmsx -cart galious.rom</div>
<p>
This lets openMSX know that the file is a ROM cartridge and that openMSX should insert it in the first available free cartridge slot. You can also use <code>-carta</code> to explicitly specify cartridge slot A.
</p>
<p>
Or, maybe openMSX didn't have the ROM in the ROM database and failed autodetection of the mapper type. You can specify the mapper to KONAMI4 like this:
</p>
<div class="commandline">openmsx galious.rom,KONAMI4</div>
<p>
Note that in practice you won't need this, since most ROM images are in the database or autodetected if they are not. Also note that the ROM type names may change in future versions of openMSX.
</p>

<h3><a id="disks">4.2. Running Disk Software</a></h3>

<h4><a id="diskimages">4.2.1. Using Disk Images</a></h4>

<p>
To run a disk image, you can type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">openmsx relax.dsk</div>
<p>
for example. Or, if you haven't registered the .dsk extension for disk images:
</p>
<div class="commandline">openmsx -diska relax.dsk</div>

<p>
You can also change disks at run time of course. Just type
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    diska &lt;diskimage&gt;
</div>
<p>
in the console to put the specified disk image in drive A. To eject the disk from drive A, use:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    diska eject
</div>

<p>
Disk images in XSA format are also supported, use them as regular disk images, but do note that they are read only. The same counts for (g)zipped disk images. Note that in zipped disk images the first file that is packed into the zip file will be used as disk image.
</p>

<h4><a id="realdisks">4.2.2. Using Real Disks</a></h4>

<p>
To use a real disk, just specify <code>/dev/fd0</code> as a disk image. This is of
course a Linux (Unix, actually) specific feature, but for now it is usable. It
may be a bit slow though, with the FDC emulation enabled. It should be just as
slow as a real disk drive, however! Don't forget that you shouldn't have it mounted to be able to use it this way. We recommend to use only write-protected disks! It is possible that you damage the contents of your disk if you don't. Windows users can try real disks by using the DirAsDisk feature. This feature is still experimental and should always used with write protected disks. Only regular disks with normal files will work with it; specify A: as disk image to use it.
</p>

<h3><a id="tape">4.3. Running Tape Software</a></h3>

<p>
openMSX supports WAV files for tape emulation! Just configure your MSX with a
cassette port (or use a premade MSX that already has it):
</p>
<div class="commandline">
     &lt;config id="CassettePort"&gt;
</div>
<div class="commandline">
     &lt;/config&gt;
</div>
<p>
Then type in the console:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
     plug cassetteport cassetteplayer
</div>
<div class="commandline">
     cassetteplayer &lt;file&gt;.wav
</div>
<p>
And then in MSX Basic, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
     run"cas:"
</div>
<p>
(or another command to load the program on 'tape'.)
</p>

<p>
You can also use the so-called CAS files. In the console, type:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
     cas &lt;tapeimage&gt;.cas
</div>
<p>
and
</p>
<div class="commandline">
     cas eject
</div>
<p>
to remove the tape from the virtual cassette player. This only works with a
patched BIOS ROM, though. You can find an example of the patch in
<code>exampleconfigs.xml</code>. This means you will have to modify the hardware configuration file of the MSX you are using. See the <a class="external" href="setup.html">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<p>
Because patching a BIOS is not really something you want, a new feature was recently added to openMSX. You can use CAS files with cassetteplayer as if they were WAV files now! They are automatically converted to WAV files, internally. Note that the loading time is drastically longer this way. On the other hand, you will be able to hear the cassette sounds now also with the CAS files... What is using cassettes with an MSX without those characteristic sounds? 
</p>

<p>
Other cassetteplayer related commands/settings you need to know of are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>cassetteplayer rewind</code>, to rewind the tape</li>
	<li><code>cassetteplayer eject</code>, to eject the tape</li>
	<li><code>set cassetteplayer_volume</code>, to set the volume of the cassette player sound (yeah, the screeching tape sounds!)</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="input">5. Input Devices</a></h2>

<h3><a id="keymapping">5.1. Default Key Mapping</a></h3>

<p>
The default key mapping is as follows:
</p>

<table>
  <tr> <td>F12</td> <td>Quit openMSX</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>F11</td> <td>Mute audio</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>F10</td> <td>Toggle console display</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>F9</td> <td>Full Throttle (maximum speed)</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>F8</td> <td>MSX STOP key</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>F7</td> <td>MSX SELECT key</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>L-ALT</td> <td>MSX GRAPH key</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>R-CTRL</td> <td>MSX CODE key</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>L-Windows</td> <td>MSX iee ('no') key</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>R-Windows</td> <td>MSX hai ('yes') key</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Pause</td> <td>Pause emulation</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>PrtScr</td> <td>Toggle full screen mode</td> </tr>
</table>
<!--
<p class="todo">
Make the table look better by using cellpadding stuff in the css.
</p>-->
<p>
The keys that do not map MSX keys, can be changed in the <code>settings.xml</code> file, see the <a class="external" href="setup.html">Setup Guide</a>.
</p>

<h3><a id="joystick">5.2. Joystick</a></h3>

<p>
To connect a fake joystick (emulated with the arrow keys), you can use the <code>plug</code> command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    plug joyporta keyjoystick
</div>
<p>
will connect a fake joystick to joystick port A. Button A of the joystick is mapped to the space bar and Button B to Left-Alt (GRAPH). For now there can be only one keyjoystick. Note that it only works if it is configured in <code>settings.xml</code>. This is of course done in the settings file that comes with openMSX. Feel free to change the configuration there.
</p>

<h3><a id="mouse">5.3. Mouse</a></h3>

<p>
To connect a mouse, you can also use the <code>plug</code> command:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    plug joyporta mouse
</div>
<p>
will connect a mouse to joystick port A. If you want the joystick emulation feature that some mice (like the Philips SBC-3810 and the Sony MOS-1) have, keep the left mouse key pressed when plugging it in, just as on a real MSX.
</p>

<h2><a id="midi">6. MIDI</a></h2>

<p>
openMSX supports the MSX-MIDI interface of the MSX turbo R GT.
To use this feature, start openMSX with the machine
<code>Panasonic_FS-A1GT</code> and plug in a MIDI device on the console.
For example:
</p>
<div class="commandline">
    plug msx-midi-out midi-out-logger
</div>
<p>
This logs all MIDI commands to a file.
Because there is no timing information logged, this is not very useful yet.
</p>

<p>
It's more interesting to connect MSX-MIDI to an actual PC MIDI device,
such as a MIDI out port or the internal synthesizer of your sound card.
On Linux, you can use the <code>midi-out-logger</code> and set a MIDI
device node, for example <code>/dev/midi</code>, as its output file.
On Windows, real MIDI devices are separate pluggables.
