The After Bussum FAQ
====================

When Bussum was over we noticed that the openMSX-CD as it was released that
day still contained some small errors. This was mainly due to the fact that
the CD was mastered rather lately and the lack of unbiased testers.

However, most errors are rather simple to circumvent. This document
describes the needed steps to use openMSX and tries to resolve some of the
confussion of the normal users of the CD.

Q: On the fair "Unknown Reality" was pixel perfect. However when I launch
   it on the CD the scope is not the same as on the fair.
A: The default accuracy of openMSX on the CD is'line perfect'
   If you want pixel perfection then open the console (<F10>) and use the
   command "accuracy pixel".


Q: When I select an empty SCC cartridge the emulator refruses to start
A: The xml files, used for empty SCC cartrdiges, on the CD were wrongly
   named. Instead of selecting the SCC cartridge in the cartridge menu
   select the empty cartridge slot and use the "options" entry in the main menu
   to enter the following extra option
   "scca.xml"  : an empty SCC cartridge in slot A
   "sccb.xml"  : an empty SCC cartridge in slot B
   "sccpa.xml" : an empty SCC+ cartridge in slot A
   "sccpb.xml" : an empty SCC+ cartridge in slot B
   or combine them
   "scca.xml sccpb.xml" for example


Q: When I start a program that uses a mouse it seems that openMSX doesn't
   support mouse emulation ?
A: The configuration on the CD doesn't automatically plug the mouse into
   the emulated MSX. To use a mouse open the console (<F10>) and use the
   command "plug joyporta mouse" for a mouse in the first joystick port or
   "plug joyportb mouse" for the second port. If you want to remove the
   mouse use "unplug joyporta" or "unplug joyportb"

Q: How do I use a joystick in openMSX?
A: For the moment there is no keyboard-to-joystick emulation in openMSX. If
   the program really needs a joystick you will have to have a joystick
   connected to your PC and plug in a joystick in the emulated MSX like you
   did with the mouse (see previous question). 
   "plug joyporta joystick0"

Q: When I run openMSX on my own Linux system I can not send CTRL+STOP to
   openMSX?
A: Make sure that your window manager doesn't capture that keycombination
   (<CTRL>+<F8>) For instance KDE by default uses this combination to
   switch to desktop 8 and the actual program (in casu openMSX) will never
   know that those keys where pressed


Q: I need to press <CAPS LOCK> twice instead of once ? And the logs
   contain masive ammounts of "Caps LED ON/OFF" 
A: This is a known bug in the SDL library, who has problems dealing with
   that specific key. A newer release of the SDL library will probably
   solve this error.
