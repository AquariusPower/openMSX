Release History
===============

This is an overview of the changes that were incorporated into past
releases.

openMSX 0.3.3 (2003-09-26)
--------------------------

This new release brings you the following improvements:
- Windows specific code was merged into the main branch. We have an
  "official" Win32 port that is part of this release.
- New HTML manuals replace the HOWTO. These manuals will make it easier for
  you to find the information you need. Also, the HTML layout looks better.
  Due to time pressure, the manuals are a bit rough at places, we'll improve
  them in the future.
- New MSX devices:
  * MSX-MIDI interface (turbo R).
  * MSX-RS-232 support (8255 UART).
  * PCM input (sampling) for turbo R via a .wav file.
- Added a debug device: write data to special I/O ports and its get logged
  to stdout or a file in a format you specify. Very useful if you develop
  MSX assembly programs in openMSX.
- Several improvements and fixes in the VDPCmdEngine; VDP emulation is even
  more accurate now.
- All read-only input files (ROM images, disk images, background pictures,
  XML) can now be gzipped or zipped and will be transparently decompressed
  by openMSX. Note that some games require write access to their disk in
  order to run (for example, Seed of Dragon).
- New dir-as-disk feature: a directory can be specified instead of a disk
  image and the contents (up to 720K) will show up as files on the MSX.
  There is no support for subdirectories (as used by DOS2) yet. This feature
  is still experimental, so please report problems if you encounter them.
- Several cassette emulation updates and new features:
  * Automatic .cas to .wav conversion in CassettePlayer.
    (no patched ROM needed anymore to run .cas files)
  * Cassette sounds are now audible.
  * Tapes can be rewinded.
  * Tapes can be forced to play.
    (like unplugging the 'remote control' plug on a real machine)
- A different keymap (e.g. for Japanese PC keyboards or to use Russian MSX
  keyboards on a US English PC keyboard) can be used now, via settings.xml.
- Keys for the key joystick are now configurable in settings.xml.
- Added joystick emulation for mouse (a feature that the Philips SBC-3810
  and Sony MOS-1 and similar mice have).
- Various console updates:
  * Tab completion behaves much more like the UNIX Bash shell now.
  * Clearer error messages.
  * More than one command is possible, use ';' to separate them.
    Especially useful for binding several commands to a single keypress.
- User-configurable channel settings for mono sound devices. You can set
  them to left, right or mono mode at run time.
- Many things are now user configurable via the console:
  * .wav input file for PCM sampler
  * log file for the printer logger
  * output file for the MIDI out logger
  * input file for the MIDI in reader
  * input and output file for the RS232-tester
- ROM database now uses SHA1 sums in stead of MD5 sums.
- The MSX turbo R machine description uses a single 4MB ROM image, plus the
  Kanji ROM. This is closer to how the real machine works.
- Several machine and extension configurations added.
- Fixed compilation on GCC 3.4-pre development version.

openMSX 0.3.2 (2003-06-09)
--------------------------

- New feature: MoonSound support.
  Original implementation taken from MAME, thanks to Jarek Burczynski
  (FM code), R. Belmont and O. Galibert (wave code) for allowing us
  to use their code in openMSX.
  Improvements and bug fixes were done by Arjan Bakker and our team.
- New MSX devices:
  * MegaRAM
  * PAC (Panasonic SW-M001)
  * Support for 8kB ROMs
- New feature: grab input (try "set grabinput on").
  When enabled, the native mouse cursor cannot escape from the openMSX
  window anymore; makes using the mouse a lot easier in windowed mode.
- New timer using the Linux Real Time Clock (RTC), which is more accurate
  than the SDL timer. SDL timer is still available as a fallback.
  Instructions to configure your system for using the RTC are in the HOWTO.
- New effect in the SDLGL renderer: afterglow (try "set glow N").
- User-configurable gamma correction (try "set gamma X").
  Also the default value is less bright than the previous hard-coded value.
- Screen accuracy works now (try "set accuracy screen").
  It is fast, but very inaccurate.
- Volume of sound devices can be adjusted at run time.
- Various console updates:
  * Commands can be on multiple lines.
  * Search in command history.
  * Command history is saved.
  * Support in SDLHi/Lo for console font PNG images in indexed mode.
    Previously, only images in RGB mode were supported.
  * Console remains usable when openMSX is paused.
- Several machine configurations added (thanks to Albert Beevendorp).
- Several extension configurations added.
- Cache coherency problem in SDLGL renderer fixed.
  This bug caused garbled graphics in for example Ark-a-Noah and Dr Archie.
- Fixed compilation on GCC 2.95.

openMSX 0.3.1 (2003-05-18)
--------------------------

- Fixed compilation on GCC 3.3.
- Fixed SDLGL renderer on XFree86 4.3.
- New feature: configurable file-extentions.
- Improved layout of help text (try "openmsx -h").
- Many improvements to the console, including:
  * Extended the console editing keys (left, right, del, bs, home, end etc).
  * Added key repeat.
  * Reset the scrollback when any key other than page up/down is used.
  * Added resizing and moving to the console.
  * SDL console characters are no longer blended (improved readability).
  * SDL backgroundimage can be scaled and can have any pixel format.
  * Fixed colour of font on GLConsole overlayed on Text1 mode.
- Emulation and event handling are now done in a single thread.
  The previous multi-threaded solution was not very portable among platforms
  or even different versions of the same platform.
  As a bonus, the single thread model is simpler and more efficient.
- Improved "make install".
- Cleanups of the directory structure.
