Release History
===============

This is an overview of the changes that were incorporated into past
releases.

openMSX 0.3.2 (2003-06-09)
--------------------------

- New feature: MoonSound support.
  Original implementation taken from MAME, thanks to Jarek Burczynski
  (FM code), R. Belmont and O. Galibert (wave code) for allowing us
  to use their code in openMSX.
  Improvements and bug fixes were done by Arjan Bakker and our team.
- New MSX devices:
  * MegaRAM
  * PAC (Panasonic SW-M001)
  * Support for 8kB ROMs
- New feature: grab input (try "set grabinput on").
  When enabled, the native mouse cursor cannot escape from the openMSX
  window anymore; makes using the mouse a lot easier in windowed mode.
- New timer using the Linux Real Time Clock (RTC), which is more accurate
  than the SDL timer. SDL timer is still available as a fallback.
  Instructions to configure your system for using the RTC are in the HOWTO.
- New effect in the SDLGL renderer: afterglow (try "set glow N").
- User-configurable gamma correction (try "set gamma X").
  Also the default value is less bright than the previous hard-coded value.
- Screen accuracy works now (try "set accuracy screen").
  It is fast, but very inaccurate.
- Volume of sound devices can be adjusted at run time.
- Various console updates:
  * Commands can be on multiple lines.
  * Search in command history.
  * Command history is saved.
  * Support in SDLHi/Lo for console font PNG images in indexed mode.
    Previously, only images in RGB mode were supported.
  * Console remains usable when openMSX is paused.
- Several machine configurations added (thanks to Albert Beevendorp).
- Several extension configurations added.
- Cache coherency problem in SDLGL renderer fixed.
  This bug caused garbled graphics in for example Ark-a-Noah and Dr Archie.
- Fixed compilation on GCC 2.95.

openMSX 0.3.1 (2003-05-18)
--------------------------

- Fixed compilation on GCC 3.3.
- Fixed SDLGL renderer on XFree86 4.3.
- New feature: configurable file-extentions.
- Improved layout of help text (try "openmsx -h").
- Many improvements to the console, including:
  * Extended the console editing keys (left, right, del, bs, home, end etc).
  * Added key repeat.
  * Reset the scrollback when any key other than page up/down is used.
  * Added resizing and moving to the console.
  * SDL console characters are no longer blended (improved readability).
  * SDL backgroundimage can be scaled and can have any pixel format.
  * Fixed colour of font on GLConsole overlayed on Text1 mode.
- Emulation and event handling are now done in a single thread.
  The previous multi-threaded solution was not very portable among platforms
  or even different versions of the same platform.
  As a bonus, the single thread model is simpler and more efficient.
- Improved "make install".
- Cleanups of the directory structure.
