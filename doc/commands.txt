accuracy
--------

  Sets the render accuracy. Currently there are three render modes:
    - screen accurate: This is the fastest but also least accurate mode.
    - line accurate: This is the recommended mode. Most tricks are 
                     rendered correctly.
    - pixel accuracte: This is the slowest but also most accuracte mode.
                       In this mode even the 'Unknown Reality scoop part'
                       is renderer correctly.
  Note: not all renderers support all render modes

  usage:
    accuracy          shows the current setting
    accuracy screen   selects screen accuracte rendering
    accuracy line     selects line accurate rendering
    accuracy pixel    selects pixel accurate rendering

    unbind <key>            undo all bindings for this key
    unbind <key> <command>  undo a specfic binding
  
  examples:
    bind PAGEUP "speed 100"
    bind PAGEDOWN "speed 50"
    unbind F9
    bind F9 "throttle off"
    bind F9,up "throttle on"
