Q: Which devices can I add to openMSX?
A: There are 4 kind of devices that you can add to openMSX
  * Memmory mapped devices
  * I/O port based devices
  * Connector based devices (joystick/printerport)
  * A combination of the 3 forms of above

Q: How do I add a memmory mapped device?
A: Inherrit from the class MSXMemDevice and implement the methods readMem
   and writeMem. Don't forget to use the getReadCacheLine and getWriteCacheLine
   if possible to gain a lot of performance.
Example: MSXSimple64KB.cc

Q: I need a device with a ROM in it. This must be something verry common. Is
   there a simpler method?
A: If it is to implement a rom you can inherit from MSXRom which has a
   method loadFile that will do all the needed filehandling to read a romfile
   into memmory. Also there is a Patch interface for Roms so that you can patch
   eg bioscalls in the rom file to be redirected to your own bioshandler.
Example: MSXRom16KB.cc

Q: How do I add an I/O port device?
A: Inherrit from the class MSXIODevice, and register the needed in- and
   out-ports with MSXMotherBoard
Example: MSXE6Timer.cc

Q: How do I add a connector based device?
A: If you want to make a brand new connector type, you must inherit specific
   connector and pluggable types from the class Connector and Pluggable.
Example: MSXPrinterPort.cc
A: If you just want to make a new device that plugs into an existing
   connector (JoystickPort, PrinterPort, ...), you must inherit from the
   specific Pluggable (JoystickDevice, PrinterPortDevice, ...)
Example: PrinterPortLogger.cc

Q: What is this EmuTime thing?
A: Every device that is timesensitive has it own emutime object.
   During the creation of the MSXDevice the internal emutime is set to the
   time of instantiation (typically zero at boot). Each device can calculate
   T-states in its own "native" time (The Z80 in 3.5MHz, the VDP in 21 Mhz,...)
   The emutime object is the way to compare the time between two devices. The
   emutime will internally correct for the possible different between the native
   frequencies. The distance function getTicksTill() and getTicksTillUp() can be
   used to find out how many native ticks are needed to catchup with an other
   device.
Example: MSXE6Timer.cc

Q: My device has to perform some action at a later time. Can my device be
   notified when this time has come?
A: Use scheduler->setSyncPoint(T,D) to register the MSXDevice to be called at
   a certain time T. When the time is arrived device D will be called by its
   method executeUntilEmuTime.
Example: sound/Y8950Timer.cc

Q: How can a device generate IRQs?
A: The class MSXCPU offers two methods raiseIRQ() and lowerIRQ(). However direct
   use of these methods is not recommended. Instead use the methods offered by 
   the class IRQHelper.
Example: VDP.cc
