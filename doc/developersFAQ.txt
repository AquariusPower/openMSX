Q: Which devices can I add to openMSX?
A: There are 4 kind of devices that you can add to openMSX
  * Memmory mapped devices
  * I/O port based devices
  * Connector based devices (joystick/printerport)
  * A combination of the 3 forms of above

Q: How do I add a memmory mapped device?
A: Inherrit from the class MSXMemDevice and implement the methods readMem
   and writeMem. Don't forget to use the getReadCacheLine and getWriteCacheLine
   if possible to gain a lot of performance.
Example: MSXSimple64KB

Q: I need a device with a ROM in it. This must be something verry common. Is
   there a simpler method?
A: If it is to implement a rom you can inherit from MSXRom which has a
   method loadFile that will do all the needed filehandling to read a romfile
   into memmory. Also there is a Patch interface for Roms so that you can patch
   eg bioscalls in the rom file to be redirected to your own bioshandler.
Example: MSXRom16KB

Q: How do I add an I/O port device?
A: Inherrit from the class MSXIODevice, and register the needed in- and
   out-ports with MSXMotherBoard
Example: MSXE6Timer

Q: How do I add a connector based device?
A: If you want to make a brand new connector type, you must inherit specific
   connector and pluggable types from the class Connector and Pluggable.
Example: MSXPrinterPort
A: If you just want to make a new device that plugs into an existing
   connector (JoystickPort, PrinterPort, ...), you must inherit from the
   specific Pluggable (JoystickDevice, PrinterPortDevice, ...)
Example: PrinterPortLogger

Q: My device has to perform some action at a later time. Can my device be
   notified when this time has come?
