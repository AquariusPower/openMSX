Q: Which devices can I add to openMSX?
A: There are 4 kind of devices that you can add to openMSX
  * Memmory mapped devices
  * I/O port based devices
  * Connector based devices (joystick/printerport)
  * A combination of the 3 forms of above

Q: How do I add a memmory mapped device?
A: Inherrit from the class MSXMemDevice and implement the methods readMem and writeMem. Don't forget to use the getReadCacheLine and getWriteCacheLine if possible to gain a lot of performance.
Example: MSXSimple64KB

Q: I need a device with a ROM in it. This must be something verry common. Is there a simpler method?
A: If it is to implement a rom you can inherit from MSXRom which has a method loadFile that will do all the needed filehandling to read a romfile into memmory. Also there is a Patch interface for Roms so that you can patch fi. bioscalls in the rom file to be redirected to your own bioshandler.
Example: MSXRom16KB

Q: How do I add an I/O port device?
A: Inherrit from the class MSXIODevice, and register the needed in- and out-ports with MSXMotherBoard
Example: MSXE6Timer

Q: How do I add a connector based device?
