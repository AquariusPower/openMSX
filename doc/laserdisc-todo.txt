TODO:
 - ack is low for 0.018s. This might be because it finishes the current frame?
 - Need for LDSDLRasterizer?
 - support for SDLGL-PP
 - Emulate r#0, bit 0
 - set svn:keywords
 - serialize state
 - Throttle when Laserdisc::readSample() is called many times per frame
 - volume of Laserdisc is too low compared to PSG
 - Three keys missing from Pioneer_PX-V60
 - Judging from the intel graphics hardware documentation, the video card
   itself can do both YUV -> RGB conversion and color keying, see:

	http://intellinuxgraphics.org/documentation.html

   However, Linux support is limited right now:

   (Maybe it does work with UMS?)

   In addition, SDL does have SDL_CreateYUVOverlay() which might just
   do the trick when hardware support is available.
