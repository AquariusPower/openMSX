TODO:
 - ack is low for 0.018s. This might be because it finishes the current frame?
 - Emulate r#0, bit 0
 - serialize state of Laserdisc
 - Throttle when Laserdisc::readSample() is called many times per frame
 - volume of Laserdisc is too low compared to PSG
 - Three keys missing from Pioneer_PX-V60
 - Judging from the intel graphics hardware documentation, the video card
   itself can do both YUV -> RGB conversion and color keying, see:

	http://intellinuxgraphics.org/documentation.html

   However, Linux support is limited right now:

   (Maybe it does work with UMS?)

   In addition, SDL does have SDL_CreateYUVOverlay() which might just
   do the trick when hardware support is available.

 - It looks like SDL does not expose the color-keying part of the hardware,
   however it does support plain YUV for video playback. Now, we could:

   1) Map the Video YUV 402P to YUV 422 (non planar, each pixel is
      four consecutive bytes of Y-Cr-Cb-Alpha). This is a cheap memcpy.
   2) Map the MSX pixels to YUV, not RGB. This can be done when the
      palette is created, so this would not impose any performance
      impact.
   3) Make SDL do YUV.
   4) OSD elements and other bits will be broken.

 - Seeking sometimes misses a keyframe or some audio
 - The laserdisc image is slightly stretched compared to the VDP output,
   causing the VDP elements and laserdisc elements not to match up in 
   Starfighters.
 - EXTINT (and associated interrupt) is not emulated correctly
