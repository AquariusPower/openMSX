TODO:
 - ack is low for 0.018s. This might be because it finishes the current frame?
 - Emulate r#0, bit 0
 - volume of Laserdisc is too low compared to PSG
 - Three keys missing from Pioneer_PX-V60
 - The laserdisc image is slightly stretched compared to the VDP output,
   causing the VDP elements and laserdisc elements not to match up in 
   Starfighters.
 - EXTINT (and associated interrupt) is not emulated correctly
