C-BIOS 0.17 (2003-08-14)
========================

C-BIOS is a BIOS written from scratch that aims to be compatible with the
MSX BIOS. The current version runs most MSX1 ROM games succesfully and
many MSX2 ROM games as well.
The machine configurations "cbios-msx1" and "cbios-msx2" let you use C-BIOS
in openMSX.
